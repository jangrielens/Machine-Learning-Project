and from ills by their art how can wretches be freed,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
no pedant yet learned nor rakehelly gay,anapaestic,wswswswsws
yet still his fond wish would arise,anapaestic,wswswsws
the breeze that so sweet on its bosom did play,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
a cow in my yard and a nag in my stable,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
in counsel there's safety e'en send for another,anapaestic,wswsswsswswsw
it brings that that's bypast and sets it down here,anapaestic,wswwswswsws

no nonsense of parsons or methodists sour,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and methinks i'm inclin'd,anapaestic,wswsws
embarrassed is a family clan,anapaestic,wswswswsw
but alas recollection at hand,anapaestic,wswswswsw
that flies in the night,anapaestic,wswsw
as a sheet all the roads were with snows overspread,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
to endure such an absence as theirs,anapaestic,swswswsws
so your poems will be,anapaestic,wwswsw
the next day at noon in the wyndham we sail,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
which must heighten the plagues of for better for worse,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
n now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
but bramble prevail'd and was duly elected,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
i stole from her hand a sweet kiss,anapaestic,wswswsws
an' i'll hae some pearlings to make mysel fine,anapaestic,wwswswswsws
if it tears up one record of blissful old times,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
an inconstant i leave a true lover you lose,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
but remember the lass on the brow of the hill,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
'tis ella the lost undone maid,anapaestic,wsswswsw
through many a turbulent year,anapaestic,wsswswsw
like a resolute peace in each country on earth,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,anapaestic,swsswswswsw
time there was when it seemed our asset,anapaestic,wswswswsw
to possession alone let thy thoughts be confin'd,anapaestic,swsswswswsws
as the worst ways were past so but small was our fear,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
the hot fire of this flames flambeau,anapaestic,swswswsws
their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
and he spak what he thout for i'd hardly a plack,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
at noon in the shade help her chaplets to weave,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
this exchange should they make it would set 'em both right,anapaestic,swswwswwswsw
so enchanted was sun by queen sea,anapaestic,swswswsws
at st alban's i din'd with a laughing gay crew,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
what though she is rural and best loves the grove,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
to a heart which dear chloe is thine,anapaestic,wswswswsw
for if life is a jest as the wisest have spoke,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw

with an aspect deceitfully fair,anapaestic,wwsswswsw
to bring down a wife whom the swains might admire,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
the sweet joys departed the friends left behind,anapaestic,swswswswsws
but alas on the morrow how dismal the sight,anapaestic,swswwsswswsw
ah sure 'tis the bus'ness of life,anapaestic,swswswsw
now her damon is pleasing no more,anapaestic,swswswsws
and murmuring seems to repeat,anapaestic,wswswsws
every promise and vow that he said,anapaestic,sswswswsws
at the end of my rainbow no treasure for me,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
and bosom'd a friend in my care,anapaestic,wswswsws
that may is the mother of love,anapaestic,wswwswsw
your la'ships have form'd many such in the air,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and to peace and good humour bid open defiance,anapaestic,wswswswwsswsw
fleeting shadows they seem that glide calmly away,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
and let no single beauty escape,anapaestic,wswswswsw
when the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
and rather than do such a naughty affair,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
can his mercy approve a selfpunishing sect,anapaestic,wwswsswswsws
now bangor we reach oh if e'er thou hadst fame,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
what joy would i say can these beauties bestow,anapaestic,wswswswswsw

'twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd,anapaestic,swswswsws
at the close of the day when the hamlet is still,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
as times will allow and your honour thinks meet,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
i wish he would phillis forget,anapaestic,wswwssws
for if she shou'd die folks will make a strange pother,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw

to transcribe from my grandmother's book a receipt,anapaestic,swswswsswsws

but when chloe with sweetness and sense in her look,anapaestic,wwsswswswsws

tears gave him some little relief,anapaestic,wswwssws
where the prudent will walk but the bolder will ride,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw

on the whole it appears and my argument shows,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
while the lassies turn round by the burn,anapaestic,swswswsws
why thus every hour does my sorrow increase,anapaestic,swsswsswwssws
to draw men as they ought to be not as they are,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
hence the stones are distain'd with the colour of blood,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
i would wipe off these tears from my eyes,anapaestic,swswswsws
get your pipes oh ye shepherds in tune,anapaestic,wswswswsw
for sixpence thy jean and thee's parted,anapaestic,wswswswsw
to disturb me with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,swswswsws
this manor this house and estate will be yours,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
where owls seek for covert and night birds complaining,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
but made up like figg's of the common redliquor,anapaestic,wswwswwswsws
that shepherd so blithsome and fair,anapaestic,wsswswsw
and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
in those lyrical sounds that enthrall,anapaestic,swswswsws
with her laws keep in sync in whatever we do,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
so his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
repine at her triumphs and die,anapaestic,wswwswsw
and she call'd it the sister of love,anapaestic,wswswswsw
now dash away dash away dash away all,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
jesus christ wants obedience now,anapaestic,swswswsws
they would now serve the fairest on earth,anapaestic,wswswswsw
i gaze on bright clouds and i fancy thee there,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
may i lose both my pipe and my crook,anapaestic,swswswsws
well i'll pray to our prophet and get you prefer'd,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
they toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
and by absence will conquer her heart or your own,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
and unable to tell which bright lass he lov'd best,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
how contented and happy we live,anapaestic,swswswsws
the swallows will see them and say their goodbye,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
now beware ye young virgins of britain's gay isle,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
i ran into words like iambic and tercet,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
pastora with blushes confest,anapaestic,wswswsws
will the pharmacy have some great cream or a pill,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
i stirr'd up my fire and close by its side,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
my flocks can no longer delight,anapaestic,wswswsws
be it thine selfaccomplish'd to reign,anapaestic,wswswswsw
then hops upon the fence to sneak,anapaestic,wswswsws
allow me to muse and to sigh,anapaestic,wswswsws
what heaven can do is quite out of the case,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
for the court did not think they were equally wise,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
and the woodbines give up their perfume,anapaestic,swswswsws
than sun moon or star,anapaestic,wswsw
i have no fault to find with the girl since i knew her,anapaestic,wswswswwswwsw
grace is a superior blessing 'tis true,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
yet to fix in the lover the friend,anapaestic,wswswswsw
should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
because that thy teeth are so white,anapaestic,wswswsws
there's nothing i dread like a versewriting wife,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
he'll plead you the gospel your charge to evade,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
so you in your marriage shall gain its true end,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
inspiration flows from them in glorious beams,anapaestic,swsswswwswsw
of a magic there is in the sound,anapaestic,swswswsws
with my fair one as blooming as may,anapaestic,wswswswsw
some arms are fur stranger than others,anapaestic,swswswsws
let his forehead with laurels be crown'd,anapaestic,swswswsws
dan petrarch of old it has often been said,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and the sound of perfection can bleed,anapaestic,wswswswsw
so charm'd so astonish'd the youth,anapaestic,swswswsw
how can tou say sae joe tou kens now,anapaestic,wswswsswsws
he's gone my dear and left me here mourning,anapaestic,swswswswsw
in the fields and the meadows all day,anapaestic,wswswswsw
can a bosom so gentle remain,anapaestic,swswswsws
were i one moment silent except in my bed,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
she turns 'em to asses or owls,anapaestic,wswwswsw
seems for ever adorn'd with a smile,anapaestic,swswswsws
with a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
who could rob a poor bird of its young,anapaestic,swswswsws
i hear the kind call and obey,anapaestic,wswswsws
'till a boat took us in and at length set us down,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
and beplaister'd with rouge his own natural red,anapaestic,wsswswswswsw
and at ease with my rival i talk of my love,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
but the matter must end on some fashion or other,anapaestic,wwswswswsswsw
make your darby delighted to sit by his joan,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
is of the same kidney,anapaestic,wwswsw
'tis his in smooth tales to unfold,anapaestic,wswswsws
be the maidens all virtuous who drink of thy tide,anapaestic,wwsswswswswsw
where the soldiers of babel bemuse,anapaestic,swswswsws
and slander itself must allow him goodnature,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
as 'twas the first instance it would be the last,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the proposal no sooner was made,anapaestic,swswswsws
with her eyes but half open her cap all awry,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
could i keep them one half minute fixed she would fall,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
i's just fit to drop whilst he's talking,anapaestic,wswswswsw
his head from his shoulders had quite been discarded,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
no matter no matter content in the shades,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
here reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
to forego the full box for his lonesome abode,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
to have any distemper that keeps them from speaking,anapaestic,wwsswswswswsw
while the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
i'm tawny i'm brawny and in the rays of this moon,anapaestic,wsswswswwswsw
i answer no no for he always was wiser,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
should we miss but a tree where we us'd to be playing,anapaestic,wswswswwswwsw
the favours of fortune i once hop'd to gain,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
ye nymphs to this maxim attend,anapaestic,wswswsws
i have left my dear phyllis behind,anapaestic,wswswssws
or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distils,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and with clamours and shrieks the old mansion infest,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
the tiger stretches limb by limb,anapaestic,wswswsws
who at the bridge would be first to fall,anapaestic,swswswsws
then vanish are lost and are thought of no more,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
theres birdsong and flowers in the spring,anapaestic,wswswswsws
more lasting than beauty and youth,anapaestic,wsswswsw
and can make a good pudding and cut out a shirt,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
but you will have trouble enough with your heart,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
and the meadows around us are mown,anapaestic,wwsswswsw
in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
and slowly yet surely the winter drew near,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
no signs of fair weather the west chester coach,anapaestic,swswswswssw
my own eyes to bear on her so that i thought,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the wars of numantia and hannibal dire,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
he bought ribbons for phillis's hair,anapaestic,swsswswsw
ye myrtles and woodbines so green,anapaestic,wswswsws
with the internal metronome setting the norm,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
we will pay them online now is no time to doze,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
take your bottle each man and away to the link,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
but now you make sport of my woes,anapaestic,wswswsws
yet the lover of sweetness must own ere they part,anapaestic,wwsswswswsws
let hope soften absence and keep off despair,anapaestic,swswswswsws
with thee o'er the world would she fly,anapaestic,wswswsws
aye to take frae his king but frae nae ane beside,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
she was fair and my passion begun,anapaestic,wswswssws
a tune or a song or the time of the year,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the girl who on beauty depends for support,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
deep engag'd in some amorous chat,anapaestic,swswswsws
now that i tying thy glass mask tightly,anapaestic,wswswswsws
but it put all the gods in a flame,anapaestic,swswswsws
and winter is deck'd with a smile,anapaestic,wswswsws
his paces are equal his motions the same,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
oh jealousy merciless foe,anapaestic,wsswswsw
ah fool to exult in a glory so vain,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
then in chat or at play with a dance or a song,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
for spring shall return and a lover bestow,anapaestic,swswswwssws
and a bed at northampton was press'd by a sinner,anapaestic,wswswswswswsw
the streams glide in silence along,anapaestic,swswssws
the constant goodnatur'd and pretty,anapaestic,wswswswsw
would you ask for his merits alas he had none,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
from being caress'd to be left in the lurch,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and his fair one i'll wager not all the year round,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
to make me wed systems which they recommended,anapaestic,swswsswwswsw
and told him how many fine things you had said,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
but now when she's auld they may envy me mair,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
we've lost sight of the way that our freedom was won,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
i can see them in beauty of life's sweet ballet,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
a female still cheerful and faithful and kind,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i'll mind a' her fashions and how she comes ben,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
that he broke his huge weapon in twain i assure you,anapaestic,wswswswswswsw
and freshen with tears the fair ground,anapaestic,wswswsws
their worships and honours and lordships and graces,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
not that i bid you spare her the pain,anapaestic,swswswsws
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and scotchman meet scotchman and cheat in the dark,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose,anapaestic,wswwswsw
and could lye with the grandeur and air of a lord,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
in the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
'tis fit that they too should partake,anapaestic,wswswsws
you love not of centaurs embattled to hear,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
this familys sluggish and tired as can be,anapaestic,wsswsswswsws
and my sonnets alas would gain credit with no man,anapaestic,wwswswswsswsw
god's most beautiful creatures of angels help me,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
that would fly to your study with fire in her looks,anapaestic,wswswsswsswsw
and at noon he goes flaunting all over the vale,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
inflam'd all at once grew the air,anapaestic,wswswsws
and my way i have lost and do pray let me in,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
your wish will too sure be obey'd,anapaestic,wswswsws
he heard the bleating of the flock,anapaestic,wswswsws
then instant return'd to his cot,anapaestic,wswswsws
but the prayer book and bible i bought for my wife,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
he will take a deep breath and blow them around,anapaestic,wwswswswsws
to the belfry chamber overhead,anapaestic,swswswsws
o'er the cuts of the river our tract we pursue,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
he kissed me he thanked me i armed him myself,anapaestic,wswswswswss
i'm grown weary of wit who but dresses for show,anapaestic,swsswswwswsw
for all his great gravity smil'd,anapaestic,wwswswsw
but i heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
was faithless and i am undone,anapaestic,wswswsws
when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem,anapaestic,wwswwswswswsw
ghouls in shadows want to play,anapaestic,swswsws
on the beach as she stood when the wild waves would roll,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
utter sounds by mere mortals not well understood,anapaestic,sswswswswsws
because they were strangers to pain,anapaestic,wswwswsw
no countryman living their tricks to discover,anapaestic,wswswwswswsw
besides he repents and he talks about god,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
so fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning,anapaestic,swswsswsswsw
and slily telt willy that cudn't be it,anapaestic,wsswsswswsw
my bow'r shall with chaplets be dress'd,anapaestic,wswswswsw
with no canting no sly jesuitical arts,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
that a buxom young girl ought to die an old maid,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
but as that increased so sorrow and care,anapaestic,swswswswsw
methought as he lay and in agony groaned,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
a hurry of hoofs in a village street,anapaestic,wswswswsws
with mirth to my labour the hours sweetly pass,anapaestic,wswwsswswsws
in my sleep now no longer thy image i see,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
but perhaps in the midst of the party and fun,anapaestic,swswwswwswsw
chuse a woman of wisdom as well as good breeding,anapaestic,swsswswswswsw
that the like case with this never happen'd before,anapaestic,wswswwswssws
soft music conveys to my ear,anapaestic,wswswsws
your grove's in no danger 'tis sacred to you,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the only place they all could rest was in a stable warm,anapaestic,wswswwswswwssw
but quite artless herself she suspected no art,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
once on a time as old stories reherse,anapaestic,wswswswsws
one breath of cold winter shall waft them away,anapaestic,swswswswsws
then quickly why don't you discover,anapaestic,wswswswsw
look here i present you this wonderful hose,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
my soul was transported to such an extreme,anapaestic,swswswswsws
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
he ponders what hell eat today,anapaestic,wswswsws
o fortune thy votaries must persevere,anapaestic,wswswwswsws
our fancies will paint what you cover with care,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
that host on the morrow lay withered and strown,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
none once was so watchful as i,anapaestic,wswwswsw
and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
no birds in our hedges shall sing,anapaestic,wswwswsw
he lov'd and was fondly deceiv'd,anapaestic,wswswsws
on the face of some river or lake,anapaestic,wswswswsw
what tenderness hints in a trembling tear,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and whether to choose puts me in a quandary,anapaestic,wsswswswwsws
each bird did attend on the spray,anapaestic,swswswsw
and rivulets murmur and echoes resound,anapaestic,wswswswssws
i start at the sound of my own,anapaestic,wswswsws
made his honours as usual and yearn'd to engage,anapaestic,swswswswswsws
and of ghosts till they're all in a sweat,anapaestic,swswswsws
who had prov'd to the shepherd unkind,anapaestic,wswswssws
when young she was handsome they envy'd me sair,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
where they splash in the stream,anapaestic,wswsws
my harry he smiles and he wipes aff the tear,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and i firmly believe if thou knew'st her as i do,anapaestic,wswswswwswwsw
to this she reply'd with disdain in her looks,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
our sage gave a sentence will be ever admir'd,anapaestic,swswswswsswsw
alas it increases my pain,anapaestic,wswswsws
left me hopeless to shun a temptation like this,anapaestic,swswswswssww
then sleep for an hour or two and no more,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
and so through the night went his cry of alarm,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
and once try'd the false twig it can cheat him no more,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
how fair and how fickle they be,anapaestic,wswwswsw
divinely bestow'd upon man,anapaestic,wswsswsw
on purpose he planted yon trees,anapaestic,wswswsws
as you sit on the terrace remembering,anapaestic,wswswsswsws
the people will waken and listen to hear,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
maecenas ne'er suited my peaceable lyre,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
but remain'd like the ass 'twixt the bundles of hay,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
come away strait to ovington for you can't think,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
the toasters and songsters may try all their art,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
who hear and receive but will do nothing for thee,anapaestic,swswswswssww
and hope is but gilded despair,anapaestic,wswswsws
ah lead forth my flock in the morn,anapaestic,wswswsws
wherein all along you gave grace the preferment,anapaestic,wswsswswswsw
sure pity he thought with such charms must be join'd,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
he drinks so did noah he swears so do i,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
the next was a gift that i could not contemn,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
you may know by the hand it had no cloven foot,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
and he had a particular friend,anapaestic,wswswswsw
two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
where my vows my devotion i owe,anapaestic,wswswswsw
fresh fruits and she cull'd me the best,anapaestic,wswswsws
said thomas to richard to speak my opinion,anapaestic,wsswswswswsw
this fledg'd from the eagle he smiling begun,anapaestic,wswswswssws
what different tasks are assign'd us by fate,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
't was daybreak yet still past the windows he saw,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
she smil'd and i could not but love,anapaestic,wswswsws
when phoebus's beams are withdrawn from our sight,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
till lost in the joy we confess that we live,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
but garrison duty is a' we can do,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
it is not for me to explain,anapaestic,wswswsws
without ever stirring an inch either way,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
in forming her children to virtue and knowledge,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
then stanhope be blest in your choice,anapaestic,wswswsws
for it was not they found to transplant but elect,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
like the rest of the dons,anapaestic,wswsws
through every middlesex village and farm,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
to perplex 'em still more and sure famine to bring,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
with scorn doth he slight all my charms,anapaestic,wswswsws
that were not important,anapaestic,wwswsw
and reading of dutch commentators in folio,anapaestic,wswswswsswsws
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the delicate droplet my whole fortune's fee,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
the lances unlifted the trumpet unblown,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the sands in thy glass in soft silence depart,anapaestic,wswswswssws
and beaumonts and bens be his kellys above,anapaestic,wswswswssws
an' i'm doubtfu' again gin it can be he's here,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
and began like a bedlam to bawl,anapaestic,swswswsws
but the rose lovely moralist suffer to teach,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
'till his sighs and his tears had so wrought on her mind ',anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
now drew every village along,anapaestic,swsswssws
and nightravens croak'd all around,anapaestic,wswswsws
the tool of a party in state or in church,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
with steady assurance all crime will evade,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
for inside we're the same from one god we do come,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
so loving yet chaste and so humble yet fair,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
exclaimed as we parted in may i'll be here,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
when the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
that when years have roll'd on though your locks be turn'd grey,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
nor refuse i thy due tho' repair'd by king james,anapaestic,wsswswswswsw
with you i must own should the glow of the plain,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
for had she known delia she must have confess'd,anapaestic,wwswswswsws
hardly a man is now alive,anapaestic,wswswsws
in a moment i seem to be there,anapaestic,swswswsws
ye lambkins that play'd at his feet,anapaestic,wswswsws
is not life to be over tomorrow,anapaestic,wswswswsws
for it was not the pride of her sex,anapaestic,swswswsws
my mother came in and i thought she'd run wild,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
but i found that a bumper can't reach the pure soul,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
thus widely remov'd from the fair,anapaestic,wswswsws
so they shine not in phillis's eyes,anapaestic,wswswswsw
he thought as a sage but he felt as a man,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
that 'twas here first in wales that i met with a goat,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
if we sit or we walk may i cast round my eyes,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
let your passion be sovereign your unrivaled guide,anapaestic,swsswswswssw
to frolic and feast and carouse,anapaestic,wswswsws
this advice he pursu'd but the remedy prov'd,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
this calm'd her resentment she paus'd for a while,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
when the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
that will help me get close to my goal,anapaestic,swswswsws
whether pensive or cheerful no longer to you,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
your pinners set right your twitcher ty'd on,anapaestic,wsswswswsw
and whilst i was silent the guards were all doubled,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
while the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold,anapaestic,wwswswswsswsw
in the midst of gay sights,anapaestic,wswsws
she brought me a sunflow'r this fair one's your due,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
but i languish and sigh,anapaestic,wwswsw
that on an occasion so much to my honour,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
of praise a mere glutton he swallow'd what came,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
yet so great was their courage so equal their skill,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
a letter in rhyme why the woman is frantick,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
that shall when i'm dressing attend like a valet,anapaestic,wswwsswswsws
religion what treasure untold,anapaestic,wsswssws
and comes forth as if frighten'd of giving delight,anapaestic,wswswsswssws
tho' the canker of time should love's blossoms destroy,anapaestic,swswswswssws
let the night like the day pass with pleasure along,anapaestic,swswswswssws
and thou would'st smile too if my fair one thou'd toast,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
varied art shows displays and a job filled my time,anapaestic,sswswswwswsw
the barristers tremble the judges grow pale,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
tho' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
nor stumble the feet nor grow dizzy the head,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i ran to the spot where a weak flower remaining,anapaestic,wswwswswsswsw
for they'll know you've fought for your country,anapaestic,wswswswsw
that dear angelface could i see it once more,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
why not soft like the phial's enticing and dim,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
sweet echo my sighs does repeat,anapaestic,wswswsws
love's morning how blithsome it shines,anapaestic,wswswsws
are at strife to be louder than her,anapaestic,wswswswsw
as long as old time shall remain,anapaestic,wswswsws
inconstant and faithless in love's the pretence,anapaestic,wswsswswsws
the friendship he felt for the fair,anapaestic,wswswsws
when will they restore order thats anyones guess,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
with their houses squares circles and signs,anapaestic,wwsswswsw
who by dint of mere humour had kept her alive,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
and felt the breath of the morning breeze,anapaestic,swswswsws
so look not for china or service of plate,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,anapaestic,swswswsws
to sigh for a heart she could never regain,anapaestic,wswswswssws
his conduct still right with his argument wrong,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and make him her slave,anapaestic,wswsw
i am just wak'd from one wou'd to god it were true,anapaestic,wswswwswswsw
my shaft in the plume of a parrot will hit,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
but oh give us their happy content,anapaestic,wswswswsw
and the truth is my scars are much deeper than face,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
too soon our grey hairs must controul,anapaestic,swswswsw
in good humour he liv'd all the days of his life,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
philomela with envy complains,anapaestic,swswswsws
in good humour i'd live all the days of my life,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
as true to his flame as this flow'r to the sun,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
then rarely approach and respectfully bow,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and as to being parfet and parfet,anapaestic,wswswswsws
mean by stuffing our heads with nonsense and lies,anapaestic,swsswswswsw
that confused and corrupted my brain,anapaestic,swswswsws
tho' secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
or how shall he form the soft lay,anapaestic,wswswsws
my soft glances you did not restrain,anapaestic,swswswsws
the nectar your sister presents to the gods,anapaestic,wswswwswsws
then sadly return to their torments again,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
next morning we sally'd and staffordshire lost,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
'twas the joy of her presence made time appear fleet,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
o cambridge attend,anapaestic,wswsw
i never once dreamt of my vine,anapaestic,wswswsws
when reason just tints them with shades of the night,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
blest sight that she lives he exclaimed with smile,anapaestic,wswswswsws
the glad zephyrs diffuse her soft strains,anapaestic,swswswsws
but the drops there in mine fill the tubes of the heart,anapaestic,wswswwswswsw
a signet a fan mount a filigree basket,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
and the closer you stop it the richer you make it,anapaestic,wwswswswsswsw
no envy his bliss cou'd annoy,anapaestic,wswswsws
if you slip not mankind can avert your sad doom,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
indeed then he scarcely could reach the far land,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
and checquer the meads and the lawns,anapaestic,wswswsws
had you drunk as he does you'd kept a good place,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
my heart beats again i again apprehend,anapaestic,wswswswswws
the peace which from solitude flows,anapaestic,wswwswsw
fieldpreaching hypocrisy learning or parts,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
that bruises and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
he would tear down a curl and then curl it again,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
for thee would she lie down and die,anapaestic,wswswsws
ah pity your soul come be of our sect,anapaestic,wswswswsws
with damon did wantonly play,anapaestic,wsswswsw
a second lamp in the belfry burns,anapaestic,wswswwsws
which swims on no water and sails with no wind,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
when we set out in life every thing has its charms,anapaestic,wwswswsswswsw
who reveals all his notes although mental they be,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
the path that conducts thee to splendor again,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
and the violets their sweetness impart,anapaestic,swswswswsw
illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
sedition and tumult and discord are fled,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and sighing cry peace to her shade,anapaestic,wswswsws
some hapless young virgin betray'd,anapaestic,wswswsws
this payment to be made with the lips breathless kiss,anapaestic,wsswwswswsws
in a world so abounding with evil,anapaestic,wswswswsws
with its moisture refreshes the ground,anapaestic,swswswsws
what it is to admire and to love,anapaestic,wswswswsw
'till off from his keffal he fell on the ground,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
and the brave christian knights in reward of my zeal,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
gaze at him with a spectral glare,anapaestic,wswswsws
then twin'd in the arms of that fair,anapaestic,wswswsws
with looks so engaging and manners like these,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
a friend whom i loved from the dawning of youth,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and a thousand dear pleasures relate,anapaestic,wwsswssws
to lighten the ship and conclude their devotion,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
she hung on his tombstone and died,anapaestic,wswwswsw
the deeper impressions she made on my mind,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
from all pious patriots who would to their best,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
to my cooler attention how dear,anapaestic,swswswsws
yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan,anapaestic,swswswsws
her damon must love her the more,anapaestic,wswswsws
and if his brave rival this blow had not warded,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
to our praise to be found,anapaestic,wswsws
but give me the wit that puts gold in the purse,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and at last freedom comes often dream'd of in vain,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
a tear for a dewdrop i hid in its fringes,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
or else to the wood he admir'd,anapaestic,wswswswsw
is a stranger to paridel's tongue,anapaestic,swswswsws
he had these ay and fifty good qualities more,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
through her lantern of magic past pleasures are seen,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
when i'm absent from fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,swswswsws
my steps did the charmer invite,anapaestic,wswswsws
for stranger to sloth and on business intent,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
from sermon to sermon took a slice and went out,anapaestic,wswsswswswsw
to persuadem tommy townsend to lend him a vote,anapaestic,swswswswswsws
the bosom display'd and the petticoat short,anapaestic,wsswswwswsw
and the nose was as plainly intended for them,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
alone my gay muse of licinnia would sing,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
from these and such evils apollo defend me,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
her sweetness her beauty and truth,anapaestic,wswswsws
strong reason's a warrior that fights out his way,anapaestic,wsswswswswsw
the lawyer as oft on the wrong side as right,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i can see them but often are blurs undefined,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
since the next tender meeting rewards all your pain,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
and lock'd the lov'd maid in my arms,anapaestic,wswswsws
prythee why so fantastick and vain,anapaestic,swswswsws
while brother dares to take his time,anapaestic,wswswsws
and not too much conscience nor too little art,anapaestic,wwswswswsws
reflecting on this with a politic view,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i go where i will and i come when i please,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
our good dean and chapter,anapaestic,swswsw
ive been stripped of my honor and burnt at the stake,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
like you i have mourn'd the long night,anapaestic,wswswsws
more precious than silver and gold,anapaestic,wsswswsw
the clear stream that runs bubbling in many a rill,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
if there's riches in love we'll hae gear enough yet,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
the lass of the mill,anapaestic,wswsw
when they fought out the rubbers on wednesday last,anapaestic,wswswsswsws
'o let me' he cried 'to the holy land go,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and you know to the sex it must be a heartbreaking,anapaestic,wwswswswswsww
such painters of old drew the queen of the fair,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i heard voices of angels in tune through it all,anapaestic,swsswswswsww
can perfumes or vermilions compare,anapaestic,wswswswsws
what joy can be greater than this is,anapaestic,swswswsws
the master of peter's,anapaestic,wsswsw
on the brow of a hill a young shepherdess dwelt,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
for people will always be kind,anapaestic,wswswsws
you also have tetrameter and pentameter,anapaestic,wswswwsswswsw
at the end of my rainbow,anapaestic,wswswsw
false allen this morn gave his hand,anapaestic,wswswsws
but such as each other may cure,anapaestic,wwswswsw
the graces have chosen with daphne to rove,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
alexis the pride of the plain,anapaestic,wswswsws
last night when i lay'd me to rest,anapaestic,wswswsws
here hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature,anapaestic,wsswswswswsw
fast fluttered his heart as his own castle towers,anapaestic,wsswswswswsw
as it stands in the acts we can prove ourselves saints,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
the undying myrtle and evergreen bay,anapaestic,swswswswwsw
so i kiss'd 'em and press'd 'em quite close to my breast,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
how pure the fresh air and how healthy the place,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and cupid alone makes her lover her darling,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
melting skin joined my tears as your souls found release,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
while earth wears a mantle of snow,anapaestic,swswswsw
that the armies of dissonance fall,anapaestic,swswswsws
i goes to the sign of the anchor,anapaestic,wswswswsw
the drum it was beating to fight they incline,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
a moment on the roofs of the town,anapaestic,wswswswsw
the dear lovely maiden is thinking on me,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
the beasts that roam over the plain,anapaestic,swswswsw
with their grand entertainments in courts,anapaestic,wswswswsw
yet their love varies not with the year,anapaestic,wswswswsw
and dost thou still love me he uttered when first,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the heads bow their lips move the congregation prayed,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
but i thought she dealt only in hearts,anapaestic,wswswswsw
and say that i lost her for want of good skill,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
what ned and is this aw that ails thee,anapaestic,swswswsws
for damon the youthful and gay,anapaestic,wsswswsw
of phyllis was always my song,anapaestic,wsswswsw
i have mark'd the sweet floweret adorning the lawn,anapaestic,wswswswswswsw
and drive poetasters from out of the realm,anapaestic,swswswswwsw
and hurl her divinity quite from the sky,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
how fleet is a glance of the mind,anapaestic,wswswsws
then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom,anapaestic,wswswswsw
on the zig zag descent rather tetchy still teed,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
but as time will not tarry our course we resume,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
where the heart us'd to warm to find civil behaviour,anapaestic,wwswswswsswsw
a man must needs look like a fool,anapaestic,wswswsws
if i knew of a kid that was mine,anapaestic,swswswsws
and mercy encouraging thought,anapaestic,wswswsws
which tho' known to be nothing but canvas and paint,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
as plutarch reports springing out of the earth,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
each wing'd with a feather of different hue,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
i'm so plagu'd with my teeth which eternally ake,anapaestic,wwsswswswswsw
for the son of alknomook will never complain,anapaestic,wwswswswssws
yet still let her principal care be her mind,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
had hag'd the poor woman half out of her life,anapaestic,swswswswwsw
for it was not the pleasure to vex,anapaestic,wswswswsw
to the satire i've penned,anapaestic,wwsswsw
a cruel disease has spoil'd her sweet face,anapaestic,wswswswsws
love strews with fresh flowrets the ground,anapaestic,swswswsw
to the olive and figtree their deputies came,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
for music must welcome the may,anapaestic,wswswsws
but the upshot on 't was that at that very bout,anapaestic,wwswswswswssw
i have found where the woodpigeons breed,anapaestic,wswswswsw
awake in my breast the soft dream of delight,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
but to call it good drink is a lye i'll be sworn,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
each meeting still serv'd to improve,anapaestic,wswswsws
i knew in a moment it must be st nick,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
and the rhime at the close how it falls with a clink,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
to find out a punishment due to his fault,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
nor trust for that care to a school or a college,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
what hope of an end to my woes,anapaestic,wswswsws
divinity heard between waking and dozing,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
to subscribe for no book yet subscribe to heidegger,anapaestic,swswswswswsws
and spar'd from the sense of a generous duty,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
between nose and eyes a strange contest arose,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
dash'd against the rough rocks and the sea for your tomb,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
we began at a loss,anapaestic,swswsw
still aiming at honour yet fearing to roam,anapaestic,wsswsswswsw
yet oh ye kind powers you are bound to protect him,anapaestic,wswswswswssw
farewell ye sad scenes of my love,anapaestic,wswswsws
and more and more forced grew the smile on his lip,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
the man who in courtship is studious to please,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
that in downright compassion to love she inclin'd,anapaestic,wwswswwswsws
to get bread to yoursel and thir wee bit things too,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
is now more engaging fince reason took place,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
from the town i first breath'd in i sally'd in haste,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
how just was her motion how sweet was her tongue,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
and he fancies no shepherd his peer,anapaestic,swswswsws
who will wrap me in rhimes and inspire me with measure,anapaestic,wwswswswswwsw
while the goats all in wonder seem on us to gaze,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
is ether thy dwelling o whisper me where,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and the pure lucid stream aganippe produces,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
in the end all agree that emotion's the key,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
yet while strephon is absent dejected dismay'd,anapaestic,wwsswswswsws
and fairer than esther,anapaestic,wsswsw
i read such things as trochee,anapaestic,wswswsw
a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
by a prattling stream on a midsummer's eve,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
what a number of temples and grottos are here,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
in a spouse so accomplish'd so young and well dress'd,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark,anapaestic,swswwsswswsw
my ellis i love thee then pay me in kind,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
two decades and more still theres oerload,anapaestic,wswswswsws
with joy to my arms as faithful as glorious,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
her wit and her air,anapaestic,wswsw
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
bright as eye ever saw,anapaestic,wswsws
yet still she's akin to the god of the day,anapaestic,swswswwswsw
and with fondness remember the day for awhile,anapaestic,wwswsswswsws
disguis'd are our pleasures as well as our woes,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
nor regrets the lost plume so his freedom he gains,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
i was tied to a chair and with sickened disgust,anapaestic,wswswswwssws
again he imparted his grief,anapaestic,wswswsws
the child he had claspt in his farewel embrace,anapaestic,wswswswssws
magnanimity faded as rivalries grew,anapaestic,swsswsswswsw
athenians i humbly beseech you explain,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
in solitude,anapaestic,wsws
we are proud and so blessed and thank god up above,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
shall swift ballads compose,anapaestic,swssws
then we doze and digest with a satisfied smile,anapaestic,wswswswwswsw
a scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on,anapaestic,wswwswswswsw
then a big pile of invoices for us awaits,anapaestic,wswswswswsws
who hearing that figg was thought such a stout blade,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
that your honour would please at this dangerous crisis,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
and the scalps which we bore from your nation away,anapaestic,wswswswwssws
they told me i came on that errand too late,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
'till charlot appear'd with a look and a smile,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
but how shall i whisper this fair one's sad case,anapaestic,wwswswswsws
ye bow'rs that with rapture i've seen,anapaestic,wswwswsw
from a poor country cure that living interment,anapaestic,wswswswsswsw
and shew in his eyes he is true to his trust,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
or ought that is costly to tempt you to eat,anapaestic,wswwswswsws
tou knows there's still fish i' the river,anapaestic,wswswswsw
he views his world through sleepy eyes,anapaestic,wswswsws
pastora heard every complaint,anapaestic,swswswsws
and when nought can be heard but the rude waterfall,anapaestic,wwswwswswsws
alas what avails all thy moan,anapaestic,wswswsws
when she sings me some amorous strain,anapaestic,wswswswsw
that in the mortar you call it a gum,anapaestic,wswswswsws
said a formal noncon whose rich stock of grace,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
and though beauteous i own thee yet still in thy face,anapaestic,wwswswswwswsw
though aware of the thorns and the danger they posed,anapaestic,swswwswwswsw
with a jack or a perch when my uncles come down,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
listen my children and you shall hear,anapaestic,swswswsws
that symbol of him full of meekness and love,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
oh venus perserv'd was the neame o' the actin,anapaestic,wswswswswwsw
and left by my friends thro' the tempest i ride,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
yet lately i saw where majestic on high,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
to enjoy it thy years will prove many too few,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
oft meet at the darkspreading yew,anapaestic,wswwswsw
when the danger was pass'd i determin'd to go,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
and nothing was left but despair,anapaestic,wswswsws
between me and my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,wswwswsws
my flocks i have often forsook,anapaestic,wswswsws
and not the fine minx recommended by more,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
my early excesses may teach you this truth,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
false woman in ages to come,anapaestic,wsswswsw
and warms the young rosebud that hope had just born,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
with such lightness and patterns and passionfilled phrases,anapaestic,wswswsswswsww
how comfortless passes the day,anapaestic,wswswsws
ye swains ah make virtue your shield,anapaestic,swswswsw
he looks for food and so do i,anapaestic,wswswsws
brand burn up bite into its grace,anapaestic,wswswsws
that border the vernal alcove,anapaestic,wswsswsw
to a waltz or a reel,anapaestic,wswsws
how many soft moments i spent in this grove,anapaestic,wsswswswsws
affection beams forth like the rays of the morn,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
we'll talk of the place when we've settled the poll,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i thought id write some poetry,anapaestic,wswswsws
she saw the poor shepherd's despair,anapaestic,swswssws
come chloe and give me sweet kisses,anapaestic,wswswswsw
magnanimous goldsmith a goosberry fool,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
may gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely,anapaestic,swswswswsw
but alas t'other day at the fair,anapaestic,swswswswsw
and make ourselves good,anapaestic,wswsw
observe but this rule which i give you in charge,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
i determin'd to send such a present to you,anapaestic,swswswswssww
and the more i with study my fancy refin'd,anapaestic,wswswsswswsw
yon hill that uprears his smooth head,anapaestic,wswswswsw
when he galloped into lexington,anapaestic,swswswsws
i write for no party nor either bespatter,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
do you tell her 'it's simple just read all you can,anapaestic,wswswswswsww
alas can i help it my fair is not here,anapaestic,wswswswswsw
sir don't be dishearten'd altho' it be true,anapaestic,swswswswsws
are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade,anapaestic,swswswwssws
where blossom the eglantine bowers,anapaestic,wsswswsw
but to wake us to sensible woes,anapaestic,wswswswsw
will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails,anapaestic,wwswswswswsw
the liquid stream parts to the ground,anapaestic,wswswsws
goastone or whatever you like in its room,anapaestic,swswsswswsw
ye nymphs ah give ear to my lay,anapaestic,wswswsws
with her sheers to cut short,anapaestic,wwswsws
from the plains from the woodlands and groves,anapaestic,wswswswsw
tho' full old are thy tow'rs yet receive my just praise,anapaestic,swswswswswsw
long ago i did write in rhyme,anapaestic,swswswsw
but that reason her passion supprest,anapaestic,swswswsws
soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended,dactyl,wswswswwsswswsw
ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie,dactyl,wwswswswswswsw
lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
there old ren leblanc had died and when he departed,dactyl,wswswswswswsw
still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal',dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,dactyl,wswsswswswswsswsw
lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed,dactyl,wwswwsswswswsww
over the sea like pathless limitless waste of the desert,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsws
but a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine,dactyl,wswswwswswswsswsw
she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
followed the old man's song and united the fragments together,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maize ear,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
waste are those pleasant farms and the farmers forever departed,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grand pr',dactyl,wswswswswwswswss
then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
for evangeline stood among the guests of her father,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness',dactyl,sswswswswsswsw
birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the ice bound,dactyl,swswswwswswsws
ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters,dactyl,sswswswswsswsw
now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
as if a hand had appeared and written upon them 'upharsin',dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,dactyl,sswswswwswsswsw
slowly they entered the tche where it flows through the green opelousas,dactyl,sswswswwswswswsws
and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert,dactyl,wswswswsswswswsw
priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
eastward with devious course among the wind river mountains,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
lingered long in evangeline's heart and filled it with gladness,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then made answer the farmer 'perhaps some friendlier purpose,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season,dactyl,swsswswswswsswsw
darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness,dactyl,wswswsswsswswsws
yet under benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle,dactyl,swsswswswswswwsw
ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward,dactyl,wswswswsswswwsw
shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them,dactyl,wswswwswswswsws
columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
on the buffalo meat and the venison cooked on the embers,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware waters,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
she too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,dactyl,wswswwswswswsws
but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
close by the chimney side which is always empty without thee,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
exile without an end and without an example in story,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,dactyl,wwswwswwswswsww
thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grand pr,dactyl,wswswswswswswss
nation scattered along the coast now floating together,dactyl,swsswswswsswsw
broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed o'er the meadows,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
stationed the dove cots were as love's perpetual symbol,dactyl,swswswwswsswsw
where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,dactyl,swswswswswwsw
and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued,dactyl,wswswswswsswsswsw
flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors,dactyl,wswsswswswsswsw
far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed,dactyl,wswswswwswswsw
there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
were the swift humming birds that flitted from blossom to blossom,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
gleamed on the sky and sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
long at her father's door evangeline stood with her right hand,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
not far withdrawn from these by the cider press and the beehives,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall,dactyl,wwswswswswswsws
how have you nowhere encountered my gabriel's boat on the bayous',dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes,dactyl,wwswwswswsswsw
as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
even the blood red ear to evangeline brought not her lover,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
all things were held in common and what one had was another's,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless,dactyl,swswswsswsswsswsw
death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests',dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
rose wreathed vine encircled a broad and spacious veranda,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows,dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her,dactyl,swswswswswswsswsw
but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight,dactyl,wswsswsswswsswsws
therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison',dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted,dactyl,wswsswswwswsswsw
distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church,dactyl,swswswswswswswsws
thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
foremost the young men came and raising together their voices,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike,dactyl,swswswsswswswswsw
man is unjust but god is just and finally justice,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
as through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the oak trees,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea shore,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers,dactyl,wwswswswwswwsw
rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,dactyl,swsswswswswsswsw
lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
something within her said 'at length thy trials are ended',dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them,dactyl,wswswswswwswsw
patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden,dactyl,wswswswswsswswsw
caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower',dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds,dactyl,wswswswsswswsws
nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses,dactyl,wwswswswswswswwsw
and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket,dactyl,swsswswswswsswsw
but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners,dactyl,wwsswsswswwswwsw
ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles,dactyl,swsswswswswswsw
stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women,dactyl,wswsswswswswsswsw
fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience',dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats,dactyl,sswswswswwswswswsw
then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow flakes,dactyl,wswswswswswwswsws
it was the month of may far down the beautiful river,dactyl,wswswwswwswsww
wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops,dactyl,wwswswswswswsw
urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her,dactyl,wwsswswsswswssw
rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath,dactyl,swswwswswswwsw
knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
all day long the wains came laboring down from the village,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,dactyl,sswswswwswsswsw
bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
blossomed the lovely stars the forget me nots of the angels,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,dactyl,sswswswswwswsw
days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grape vines,dactyl,swsswswswswsws
that on the day before with horses and guides and companions,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and what their errand may be i know not better than others,dactyl,wswsswswswsswsw
farewell' said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance,dactyl,wswswsswsswsswsw
as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven',dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
but it was long ago in some far off place or forgotten,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
she in turn related her love and all its disasters,dactyl,wwswsswswwswsw
dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,dactyl,wwswswwswswwsw
ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers,dactyl,swswswsswswswswsw
triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me,dactyl,swswswswswswswsws
smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded,dactyl,wswswwswswwswsw
there the long wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,dactyl,wswswswswsswswwsw
when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
said with a sigh to the friendly priest 'o father felician,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
stalwart and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the blood red,dactyl,swswswswswwswsws
roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
came o'er her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching,dactyl,sswswsswsswsswsw
lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
for he told them tales of the loup garou in the forest,dactyl,wwswswswsswwsw
fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
finding among the children of penn a home and a country,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
cotton trees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
far offindistinctas of wave or wind in the forest,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,dactyl,sswswsswswsswsw
somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas,dactyl,wswswwsswsswsswsw
but as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley,dactyl,wswsswsswswswwsw
grew up together as brother and sister and father felician,dactyl,wswsswsswsswsswsw
still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep,dactyl,wswswswswswswswwsw
thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,dactyl,wwswswswswwsw
stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsws
long under basil's roof had he lived like a god on olympus,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them,dactyl,sswsswswswwswsws
back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
like the protecting hand of god inverted above them,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe',dactyl,swswswswswswswswsw
hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,dactyl,wswswwswsswsswsw
so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the sea side,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
over evangeline's face at the words of basil a shade passed,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
distant secluded still the little village of grand pr,dactyl,sswswswswswswss
for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate,dactyl,wwswwswwswsswsw
in doors warm by the wide mouthed fireplace idly the farmer,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,dactyl,wswswwswsswsswsw
having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sjour nor port royal,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer,dactyl,swswswswswwsw
lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to morrow,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us',dactyl,wswwswwswwswsw
said as they journeyed along 'on the western slope of these mountains,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the king row,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
nor six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated,dactyl,swswsswswsswsw
so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended,dactyl,wwswswswsswsswsw
like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsws
silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,dactyl,sswsswswswswsws
and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand',dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden,dactyl,wswswswwsswswswsw
dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle',dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
silence reigned o'er the place the line of shadow and sunshine,dactyl,swswwswswsswsw
strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of hemlock,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,swswswswsswsswsw
met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid air,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
borne aloft on his comrades' arms came michael the fiddler,dactyl,swswwswswsswsws
northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
thus to the gaspereau's mouth they hurried and there on the sea beach,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk maid,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
shaded by china trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happy,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie,dactyl,wswsswswswswswwsw
deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,dactyl,sswswswwswswswsw
have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes,dactyl,wwswswswswswsws
down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune,dactyl,wswswwsswswwsswsw
inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions,dactyl,wwswswwsswwswsw
firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried,dactyl,wswsswswsswsswsw
merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel,dactyl,sswswswswsswswsw
and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden,dactyl,sswswswswswsw
noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
then from a neighboring thicket the mocking bird wildest of singers,dactyl,wswsswsswswswswsw
seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
camp fires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsws
strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her,dactyl,wswsswswsswswsws
sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated,dactyl,wswswwswswswsswsw
thereupon the priest her friend and father confessor,dactyl,swswswswsswsw
twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
more in a single night than a whole canadian summer,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
matrons and maidens sat in snow white caps and in kirtles,dactyl,sswswswswswwsw
and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,dactyl,wswsswswswsswsw
lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
patience' the priest would say 'have faith and thy prayer will be answered,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
gabriel' cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward,dactyl,sswswswsswswwsw
rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them',dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemy's cannon,dactyl,wwsswswswwsswsw
meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides,dactyl,swswswsswswswswsw
under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward,dactyl,sswswswswwswswwsw
down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,dactyl,swswwswswswswwsw
and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,dactyl,wwsswswswswwssw
there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
haunt of the humming bird and the bee extended around it,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,dactyl,wswswwswswswwsw
fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed,dactyl,swswswswsswswswsw
half way down to the shore evangeline waited in silence,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand pr,dactyl,sswsswswswswswss
three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction,dactyl,wswswswswwswswsw
while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood gates,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children,dactyl,sswswswswswwsswsw
beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters,dactyl,wwswswswwsswsw
silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly 'i cannot,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsws
softly the words of the lord 'the poor ye always have with you',dactyl,swswswswswswsws
all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic,dactyl,wswswswsswswsw
and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
feasted and slaked their thirst from the water gourd of the teacher,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes',dactyl,wwswwswswwswwsw
raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,dactyl,sswswswwsswswsw
only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
having no other care than dispensing music to mortals,dactyl,sswsswswswswsws
or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance,dactyl,wswswswwsswswsw
white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak leaves,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one,dactyl,wswswswswsswswsws
fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedict's daughter,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering fire light,dactyl,swswswswswsswsws
mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
sat conversing together of past and present and future,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad,dactyl,swswwswswswswswsw
benedict knew by the hob nailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm yards,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise,dactyl,wwswwswwswswwsw
smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted,dactyl,wswswswswswswsswsw
many a youth as he knelt in church and opened his missal,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
ride in the gaspereau's mouth with their cannon pointed against us,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
as the emigrant's way o'er the western desert is marked by,dactyl,wwsswswwswsswsw
forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
fair was she and young but alas before her extended,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
struggled together like foes in a burning city behind him,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
there the long absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven,dactyl,wsswswswswswsw
vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
home to their roosts in the cedar trees returning at sunset,dactyl,wswswwswswswsws
therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river,dactyl,sswwswwswwswsww
when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
proud of her snow white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile,dactyl,sswsswswswswsws
shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them,dactyl,wswswsswsswsswsw
but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,dactyl,wswswswswswswssw
pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men,dactyl,wswswswwsswswsws
filled was evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger,dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening,dactyl,wswswswswsswsswsw
then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
from the far off hunting grounds of the cruel camanches,dactyl,wwswswswwswssw
breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest,dactyl,sswswsswswswwsw
looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
then would they say 'dear child why dream and wait for him longer,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsws
and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee',dactyl,wswswswswswsws
pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
loud and sudden and near the notes of a whippoorwill sounded,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
whirl of the giddy dance as it swept and swayed to the music,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
long within had been spread the snow white cloth on the table,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,dactyl,wswsswswswswswwsw
into whose clay built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven',dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked,dactyl,wswswwswswswsws
as from the mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you,dactyl,swswswswsswswsws
silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith,dactyl,sswswswwswswswsw
unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors,dactyl,sswsswswwswwsw
in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy,dactyl,wwsswswswswswsw
happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
lowing they waited and long at the well known bars of the farm yard,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector,dactyl,swswswswsswswsw
painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its moss grown,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,dactyl,wwsswswswwswwsw
which like a network of steel extended in every direction,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
sat in his elbow chair and watched how the flames and the smoke wreaths,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the ear rings,dactyl,sswswswwswswswsw
then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
be of good cheer my child it is only to day he departed,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows,dactyl,wwsswswwswwswwsw
rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven,dactyl,wswswswswsswswsw
farewell' answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,dactyl,wswswsswsswsswsw
at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,dactyl,wwswwswswsswwsw
but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,dactyl,wwswswsswsswwsw
thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers,dactyl,wwswwswwswswwsw
but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment,dactyl,wswswwswswswwsw
all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience,dactyl,wwswswswswsww
such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsws
rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,dactyl,wswswswwsswswsw
voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,dactyl,wswsswswwswwsw
soon o'er the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsws
filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth,dactyl,wswswswswswwsws
shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
flagons of home brewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
sunshine of saint eulalie' was she called for that was the sunshine,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
close at her father's side was the gentle evangeline seated,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,dactyl,wswswswswsswsswsw
patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,dactyl,swswswswswswsswsw
then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,dactyl,wswsswwsswswssw
then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith,dactyl,wwswwswwswsswsw
up and away to morrow and through the red dew of the morning,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house tops,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
shining with snow white plumes large flocks of pelicans waded,dactyl,sswswswswsswsw
solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter,dactyl,wswswswswwswsw
he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,dactyl,swswswswswswswsws
deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,dactyl,wswsswswswsswsw
with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement,dactyl,wwswswswswsww
that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty,dactyl,wwswswswswwsswsw
not through each devious path each changeful year of existence,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children,dactyl,sswwswwswsswsw
when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer,dactyl,wswsswswwswswsw
as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
coureurs des bois are they and famous hunters and trappers',dactyl,wswswswswswsws
brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,dactyl,sswswswwswswswsw
nut brown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grand pr,dactyl,wswswswswswswswss
down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,dactyl,wwswswswwswwsw
must we in all things look for the how and the why and the where fore,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,dactyl,wswsswswswsswsw
showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
benedicite' murmured the priest in tones of compassion,dactyl,wswsswswswswsw
then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight,dactyl,swswswswswswsswsw
long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,dactyl,swswwswsswsswsw
found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
friends they sought and homes and many despairing heart broken,dactyl,swswswsswsswsw
hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music,dactyl,swswswswswwsw
god's name' shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,dactyl,swsswswswswsswsw
when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
only more beautiful made by his death like silence and absence,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,dactyl,wswswwswsswsswsw
meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders,dactyl,wswswwswsswswwsw
rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,dactyl,sswswswwswswsws
opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together,dactyl,swswswsswsswsswsw
into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling,dactyl,sswswswswswwsw
all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people,dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsws
so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands,dactyl,sswswsswswswsws
called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all saints,dactyl,wswsswsswsswswsws
thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,dactyl,swswswswsswsswsw
patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection,dactyl,swswswsswswswswsw
pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion,dactyl,sswswswswsswsw
black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,dactyl,wswswwswswswswwsw
unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished,dactyl,swswwswswswswsws
softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
said with a smile 'o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another,dactyl,swswswswwswswsw
other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,dactyl,wswsswswswswwsw
so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning,dactyl,swswswswswswswsws
even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
till evangeline brought the draught board out of its corner,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,dactyl,wwswswsswsswsw
bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken,dactyl,wswswwsswswswswsw
lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes,dactyl,wswswswwsswsws
into their little camp an indian woman whose features,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cart wheel,dactyl,swswswswswwswswsw
stole o'er the maiden's heart and basil somewhat embarrassed,dactyl,wswswswsswswsw
side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
followed the long imprisoned but patient acadian farmers,dactyl,sswswsswsswsswsw
father leblanc' he exclaimed 'thou hast heard the talk in the village,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
here and there in some open space and at intervals only,dactyl,wwswwsswswswssw
noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
through the sweet water valley precipitate leaps the nebraska,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom,dactyl,swswswswwswswwsw
gabriel lajeunesse' said others 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl,sswsswsswswwsw
happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe',dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
gleamed and floated away in mingled and infinite numbers,dactyl,swsswswswswswsw
under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand pr,dactyl,wswsswswswswswswss
and to the south from fontaine qui bout and the spanish sierras,dactyl,wwswswswswwsswsw
over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seemed to echo,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven,dactyl,wswswswwswwssw
for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsws
lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana',dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,sswsswswsswsw
till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
when the chase is done will return again to the mission',dactyl,wwswwswswswwsw
swinging from its great arms the trumpet flower and the grapevine,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
patience' whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,dactyl,swswswswsswsswsw
with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished,dactyl,wwswswwswwswsww
echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains,dactyl,wswswswswswwswsw
shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung,dactyl,swsswswswswsws
feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,dactyl,sswswswswwsswsw
hewn from the cypress tree and carefully fitted together,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,dactyl,wwswswwsswswwsw
and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
let me essay o muse to follow the wanderer's footsteps,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmael's children,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey,dactyl,wswwswwswswssw
there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,dactyl,wwsswswwsswswsw
till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
there stood the broad wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,dactyl,wswsswsswsswsswsw
see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci devant blacksmith,dactyl,wwsswswswwswssw
and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat,dactyl,swswswsswsswswsws
soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,dactyl,wswswswswsswsswsw
there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains,dactyl,wswswswsswswsw
sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
vacant their places were or filled already by strangers,dactyl,sswsswwswsswsw
laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manuvre,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted',dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them,dactyl,swsswsswswsswsw
and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow white,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
titan like stretches its hundred hands upon the mountain and meadow,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsws
ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is patient,dactyl,wswswsswswswswwsw
all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,dactyl,sswsswsswsswsswsw
over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
where is the thatch roofed village the home of acadian farmers,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
rang through the house of prayer and high o'er the heads of the others,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father,dactyl,wswswswsswswswsw
into the east again from whence it late had arisen,dactyl,wswswswwswswsw
foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,dactyl,swsswswswswswsw
lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
over the pallid sea and the silvery mists of the meadows,dactyl,sswswswwswswswsw
into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore tree by the window,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp fire,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and fire flies,dactyl,swswswswswswswsws
this is the compass flower that the finger of god has planted,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,dactyl,wwsswsswsswswwsw
came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it,dactyl,swsswswswswswsw
water lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations,dactyl,swsswswswswsswsw
slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent,dactyl,swswswswswwswsws
gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
blushed at each blood red ear for that betokened a lover,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
cheered by the good man's words evangeline labored and waited,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
old folk and young together and children mingled among them,dactyl,wswswsswswswsws
then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,dactyl,wswswsswsswsswsw
blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watch dog,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless,dactyl,swswswwswswwsw
tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunquerque,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard,dactyl,wswswswwswswsw
opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
down the hillside bounding they glided away o'er the meadow,dactyl,wwswswwsswswwsw
laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,dactyl,wwswwswwswswwsw
under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barn doors,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance,dactyl,wwswswswswswwsw
spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,dactyl,sswswswwswswsws
and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor,dactyl,sswswswswswwsw
then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man,dactyl,wwsswswwswswwsw
from the accordant strings of michael's melodious fiddle,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway,dactyl,sswswsswswswswsw
gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image,dactyl,swswswsswswswwsw
built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village,dactyl,wswswwswswswwsw
four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
wandered wailing from house to house the women and children,dactyl,swsswswswsswsw
day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people,dactyl,wwswswswswswwsw
gabriel lajeunesse' they said 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl,sswsswswswwsw
art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me,dactyl,wswwswswswswsws
peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
dwells another race with other customs and language,dactyl,swswswswsswsw
thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
not so thinketh the folk in the village' said warmly the blacksmith,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
and the streets still re echo the names of the trees of the forest,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,dactyl,swswswswswswwsws
such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries,dactyl,wswsswswswswswwsw
stood the houses of planters with negro cabins and dove cots,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth stone,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,dactyl,wswswswsswswsw
like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered,dactyl,wwswswswswswsw
gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation,dactyl,wswswswswwswswsw
in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherine's tresses',dactyl,wswswwswswswsw
reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens,dactyl,swswswswwswsswsw
where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected,dactyl,swswsswswswsws
where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor,dactyl,wwswwsswsswsswsw
fear no evil my friend and to night may no shadow of sorrow,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,dactyl,swswswswswswswsws
down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,dactyl,sswswswswswwsw
urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public,dactyl,wswswswswswwsswsw
and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm chair,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
while from its rocky caverns the deep voiced neighboring ocean,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,dactyl,wswswwswswswsswsw
with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
found they the trace of his course in lake or forest or river,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saint like,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels,dactyl,swswswswsswsswsw
all the year round the orange groves are in blossom and grass grows,dactyl,wwswwswswwsswsw
there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
many a farewell word and sweet good night on the door step,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow,dactyl,swsswsswswswswsw
and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music,dactyl,swswwswswswwsw
worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters,dactyl,wswswwswswswwsw
as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden,dactyl,swswwswswswswsw
then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sand bars,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsws
and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story,dactyl,wswswsswswswsws
touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland,dactyl,swswswswsswsswsw
painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
sun illumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,dactyl,wswswswsswsswsw
sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff half way to his nostrils,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
so death flooded life and o'erflowing its natural margin,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort,dactyl,wswswswswswwswsw
cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,dactyl,sswswswswswwsw
rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
and when she awoke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsws
broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
sought for their kith and their kin among the few acred farmers,dactyl,wswswwswswwswsw
slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father,dactyl,swswswswwswswswsw
from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob,dactyl,swsswswswwsswsw
here and there rise groves from the margins of swift running rivers,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded,dactyl,wwswwswwswswsw
faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded 'to morrow',dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
thus did evangeline wait at her father's door as the sunset,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with home brewed,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
flashed like the plane tree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain,dactyl,wswswswsswswwsw
but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
keenly the lightning flashed and governed the voice of the echoing thunder,dactyl,wswswswswswswsswsw
blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,dactyl,sswswswswswwsswsw
thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
lo o'er the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery sea weed,dactyl,swswswswswwswsws
sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded,dactyl,swsswswswswswsws
thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
followed his flying steps and thought each day to o'ertake him,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders,dactyl,wwswswwswwsswsw
charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
long live michael' they cried 'our brave acadian minstrel',dactyl,swsswswswsswsw
children's children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise,dactyl,swsswsswsswswsws
and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
so at the hoof beats of fate with sad forebodings of evil,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the church doors,dactyl,sswsswswswwswsws
might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
basil was benedict's friend their children from earliest childhood,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grand pr,dactyl,swswswswswswswss
vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
e'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank,dactyl,wswsswswswswswswsw
brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children',dactyl,wswwswswswswswsw
many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
freeze in fantastic shapes on the window panes in the winter,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and from its chimney top ascending and slowly expanding,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
that through the pines o'er her father's lodge in the hush of the twilight,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya,dactyl,wswswswswwswsws
gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
as at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,dactyl,wswswsswswswsws
over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him',dactyl,wswswswswswsws
and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire flies,dactyl,wwswwsswswswwssw
brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public,dactyl,swswswswsswsswsw
ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor,dactyl,wwswsswswswsww
thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit trees,dactyl,swswswswsswswsws
silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,dactyl,sswswwswswswsswsw
swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him,dactyl,sswswswswswsswsw
presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,dactyl,sswswswsswsswsw
here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal,dactyl,wwswswswwsswsw
while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,dactyl,swswswswsswswsw
and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
sea fogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana',dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grand pr,dactyl,swswwswswswswswss
into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,dactyl,wwswswswwswwsw
thus to the gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
gone is gabriel gone' and concealing her face on his shoulder,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
knelt at her father's side and wailed aloud in her terror,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying,dactyl,wwswwswsswwswsw
bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence,dactyl,swsswswswswswsw
meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,dactyl,wwsswswswswsswsw
arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
broke the silence and said 'if you came by the atchafalaya,dactyl,swswswswswwswsws
silent at times then singing familiar canadian boat songs,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it,dactyl,swswswswwswsswsw
let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,dactyl,wswswswwswswsswsw
floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest,dactyl,wswsswswswswsws
paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
then with a blush she added 'alas for my credulous fancy,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
on the banks of the tche are the towns of st maur and st martin,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
naked snow white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber,dactyl,swswswwswswwsw
knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,dactyl,swswswswwswsswsw
tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
and at the head of the board the great arm chair of the farmer,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things,dactyl,sswswsswsswswsws
she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,dactyl,wswswsswswswwsw
cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell',dactyl,swsswswswswswsw
sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin,dactyl,swsswswsswsswsw
for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
here is baptiste leblanc the notary's son who has loved thee,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then at the door of evangeline's tent she sat and repeated,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,swswswswwswsswsw
while they repeated his prayer and said 'o father forgive them',dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour,dactyl,wswsswswswswwsw
whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
all her o'erburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered 'despair not',dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
prisoners now i declare you for such is his majesty's pleasure',dactyl,swswswswswswsswsw
unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning',dactyl,swswswswwswsw
wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom,dactyl,swswwswswswwsw
fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee,dactyl,wswwswswswsswsw
there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink horn,dactyl,wswsswsswswswsws
ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a nobleman's palace,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters,dactyl,wswswwswswswsswsw
or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit',dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers,dactyl,wwsswswswswwsw
moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and o'er the horizon,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse,dactyl,swswswswwswswwsw
driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea shore,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook side,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,dactyl,wswswswswwswswsw
silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
now in the noisy camps and the battle fields of the army,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming',dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,dactyl,sswsswswswswsws
silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted,dactyl,wswswwswswswsws
but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes press,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike,dactyl,swswswswsswsw
not in word alone but in deed to love one another,dactyl,wwswswswswswsw
late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
this was the old man's favorite tale and he loved to repeat it,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her,dactyl,swswswswswswsswsw
broke up all further speech away like children delighted,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded,dactyl,wswswswwswswsw
hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
where her canadian husband a coureur des bois had been murdered,dactyl,wswsswswswswswwsw
looked on the happy valley but ne'er from their station descended,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
she would commence again her endless search and endeavor,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle,dactyl,swswswwswswwsw
waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers,dactyl,sswswswswswsws
shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,dactyl,wwswwswsswsswsw
then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
here in the houseless wild to direct the traveller's journey,dactyl,wswsswswswsswsw
there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wild flowers,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey',dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy,dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
for it recalled the past the old acadian country,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen',dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow,dactyl,swswswswwswsswsw
hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice,dactyl,swswwsswswsswsw
stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms,dactyl,swswswswswwsw
wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
near to the bank of the river o'ershadowed by oaks from whose branches,dactyl,wswswwswswswswwsw
full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice,dactyl,swswswsswsswsswsw
and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children',dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm yard,dactyl,sswsswswswswswsw
warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand,dactyl,wswswsswsswswsws
homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
under the orchard trees and down the path to the meadows,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood,dactyl,wswswswswwswsw
voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farm yards,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor,dactyl,wswswswwsswsswsw
knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each,dactyl,sswsswswsswswsws
thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains,dactyl,swswswswswswwsw
lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers,dactyl,swswwswsswsswsw
oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water,dactyl,wswswswswswswwsw
he was beloved by all and most of all by the children,dactyl,wswswwswwswwsw
lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the sea shore,dactyl,wswswwsswswswsws
quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness,dactyl,swswwswswswsswsw
weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord,dactyl,swswswswswswsswsw
many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk,dactyl,sswswsswswswsws
fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews,dactyl,sswswswswsswsswsw
and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters,dactyl,wswswswswwswsw
as when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer,dactyl,wwswswswswswsws
gabriel o my beloved' and died away into silence,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,dactyl,sswswswswsswsw
friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
welcome' the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold,dactyl,swswswswwswswwsw
at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the church yard',dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
thatched were the roofs with dormer windows and gables projecting,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome,dactyl,sswswswswswswsw
like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,dactyl,wwswswswswwsswsw
tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us',dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom,dactyl,swswswswswwsw
take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding,dactyl,swswswswswswsws
hearing the homelike sounds of his mother tongue in the forest,dactyl,sswswswwswswwsw
dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers,dactyl,wswswwswswswswwsw
and of the white ltiche the ghost of a child who unchristened,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and of the marvellous powers of four leaved clover and horseshoes,dactyl,wswsswsswswsswsw
meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain and away to the northward,dactyl,swswswswswswswwsw
all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun,dactyl,wswswswwswswswsw
fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers,dactyl,wswswswsswswsw
wandered alone and she cried 'o gabriel o my beloved,dactyl,wswswwswswswsws
columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were,dactyl,sswsswsswsswsw
entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,dactyl,wwswswswswsswsw
echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness,dactyl,swswwswswswsws
but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people,dactyl,wswswswwswswwsw
mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
staining the desert with blood and above their terrible war trails,dactyl,sswswswswswswsws
all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him,dactyl,wswswswswsswswsws
then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
far to the north he has gone' continued the priest 'but in autumn,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska,dactyl,wswswsswswswswsw
over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches,dactyl,sswswswswswswswsw
mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses,dactyl,swsswswswswswwsw
told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created,dactyl,wswswwsswswswswsw
then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman,dactyl,wswsswswswswsswsw
passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,dactyl,wswswwswswswwsw
spake he as after the tocsin's alarum distinctly the clock strikes,dactyl,wswswswswsswswsws
then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations,dactyl,wswswwswswsswsw
list to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
gladdened the earth with its light and ripened thought into action,dactyl,swswswswsswswsw
scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october,dactyl,swswswswsswswsw
filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers,dactyl,sswswsswswswwsw
so that the guests all started and father felician astounded,dactyl,wswswswswswsswsw
fled away from the shore and left the line of the sand beach,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies,dactyl,wswsswswswswswsw
thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting,dactyl,wswswswwsswswsws
sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them,dactyl,wswswsswswsswsw
built of the drift wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,dactyl,wswswswswswwsw
then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table,dactyl,wwswswswswwsw
seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
handed down from mother to child through long generations,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest',dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them,dactyl,wwsswswsswsswsw
on the morrow to meet in the church where his majesty's mandate,dactyl,wwsswswwswwsswsw
you are convened this day' he said 'by his majesty's orders,dactyl,wswswswswwsswsw
peasant's cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows,dactyl,swswswswswsswsw
hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
ren leblanc will be here anon with his papers and ink horn,dactyl,wswswswswwswsws
but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grand pr,dactyl,wswswswsswswswss
cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,dactyl,swswswswswswswsw
drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together,dactyl,wswswswwswswsws
not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people',dactyl,sswswswswswswwsw
but evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision that faintly,dactyl,swswswswswwsswsw
that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over,dactyl,wwswswswswswsw
dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,dactyl,wwswswswswswswsw
faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,dactyl,wswswwswswswswsw
out of the self same book with the hymns of the church and the plain song,dactyl,wswswswswswswsws
something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders,dactyl,swswwswswsswsw
fall on this house and earth for this is the night of the contract,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
as o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose,dactyl,wswswswswswsws
passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned,dactyl,swswswswswswsw
thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places,dactyl,wswswswswswswsw
there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith,dactyl,swswswsswsswsw
there too the dove cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,dactyl,wswswswwswsswsw
softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village,dactyl,wswswswswswswswsw
for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations,dactyl,wswswswswsswsw
meekly she bowed her own and murmured 'father i thank thee',dactyl,wswswswswswsws
but reason heard and nature well perused,iambic,wswswswsws
a knight of eighteen hundred pounds a year,iambic,wswswswsws
stretch their long arms to join the distant main,iambic,wswswswsws
as such is love by realms ador'd,iambic,wswswsws
would man but gather he might live for ever,iambic,wswswswswsw
committed once into the public arms,iambic,wswswswsws
cent'ring at last in having none at all,iambic,wswswswsws
my self transported to a rising ground,iambic,wswswswsws
the fairest garlands of th' aonian grove,iambic,wswsswswswsw

'for me the beau has aim'd to be a wit,iambic,wswswswsws
or jealousy with rank'ling tooth,iambic,wswswsws
the pious office unperform'd he left,iambic,wswswswsws
with joy i started nor approach'd too near,iambic,wswswswsws

this image on the medal place'd,iambic,wswswsws
where wellworn slaves obsequious to the call,iambic,wswswswswsw

the billows booming o'er his head,iambic,wswswsws
you'll find in sure revenge affronted love,iambic,wswswswsws
still with th' entraptur'd strains the valleys ring,iambic,swswswswssw
and her moist palm with eager fingers press,iambic,wswswswsws
the painful cares that vex the toilsome spring,iambic,wswswswsws
no pompous grandeur there adorns the grove,iambic,wswswswsws
for fix'd or worth her thought this rolling ball,iambic,wswswswsws
then clad in weeds of woe i see thee come,iambic,wswswswsws
ah draw the veil shrill trembles thro' the air,iambic,wswswswsws
one meal or shelter for one moment there,iambic,wswswswsws
to yonder stars for other ends they shine,iambic,wswswswsws
by supplemental shifts the best he may,iambic,wswswswsws
something eternal had there e'er been nought,iambic,wswswswsws
should rank with thee thou scum of earth,iambic,wswswsws
the courtier breaks his word 'tis true,iambic,wswswswsw
with the soft thrillings of the tragic muse,iambic,wswswswsws

o thou full of beauty full of fame,iambic,swswswsws

reckless ambition that right onwardn wends,iambic,sswswswswsw
