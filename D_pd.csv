and as around thy shadows sail,iambic,6,30,6,wswswsws
famed sages lighted up the pagan world,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswsws
who give to chance the world's that round us roll,iambic,6,49,10,wswswswsws
yet if we look more closely we shall find,iambic,6,41,9,wswswswsws
hail happy chief whose valour could deserve,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws
in vain you'd fly to yonder shrubs and plants,iambic,6,45,9,wswswswsws
nor wash'd in ocean as from rome he pass'd,iambic,6,42,9,wswswswsws
and teeming ewes that still their burdens bear,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws

where science only feigns to dwell,iambic,6,34,6,wswswsws
the coach was order'd in they step,iambic,6,34,7,wswswsws
still stranger much that when at length mankind,iambic,6,47,8,wswswswsws

and thou thyself o'er ev'ry country sown,iambic,6,40,7,wswswswsws
and shall return it with neglect,iambic,6,32,6,wswswsws
unless it suits with my own humour too,iambic,6,38,8,wswswswsws
scarce can the tortur'd mind the thought sustain,iambic,6,48,8,wswswswsws
and force defeated make them slaves by fraud,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
in pure goodmanners scorch'd to death,iambic,6,37,6,swswswsw
yea by thy sympathy unseen shall feel,iambic,6,37,7,wswswswsws
and live in short like courtly friends,iambic,6,38,7,wswswsws
that little birdies chirp and sing,iambic,6,34,6,wswswsws
three girls preceded all by time endear'd,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
this bleeding heart this trembling hand to thine,iambic,6,48,8,wswswswswsw
and let them ken if goud's their pride,iambic,6,38,8,wswswsws

no sound of hammer or of saw was there,iambic,6,38,9,wswswswsws
and the last night which shou'd have brought me rest,iambic,6,52,10,wswswswsws
they plac'd respectfully before the king,iambic,6,40,6,wswswswsws
in happy chains our daring language bound,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
as if the summer's labour past she chose,iambic,6,40,8,wswswswsws
her sacred domes involv'd in rolling fire,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswswsw
and where our wants have end our love begins,iambic,6,44,9,wswswswsws
which set the living firmament on fire,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswswsw
and haunt me in my midnight walk,iambic,6,32,7,wswswsws
can hopes of heav'n bright prospects of an hour,iambic,6,47,9,wswswswswsw
that glads the ploughman's sunday morning's round,iambic,6,49,7,wswswswsws
and sweep their lofty strings those awful strings,iambic,6,49,8,wswswswsws
at least with men of florio's breeding,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswsws
sunk down with sickness faint and wan,iambic,6,37,7,wswswsws
now in the milder garb of ridicule,iambic,6,34,7,wswswswsws
in thrill'd remembrance of the vanish'd hours,iambic,6,45,7,wswswswswsw
to thy pale and trembling bride,iambic,6,31,6,wwswswsw

when frosts have whiten'd all the naked groves,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws
hope things may mend in flanders,iambic,6,32,6,wswswsw
and lull'd thy slumbers with an airy song,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws
nor can my radiant angel question mine,iambic,6,38,7,wswsswswsws
sure at his birth things not unknown of old,iambic,6,43,9,wswswswsws
and stamps his pray'rs for once sincere,iambic,6,39,7,wswswsws
joys which alone from thy fair laws arise,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws
and sure 'tis this is keeney'd burney's fort,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws

whose worth deserves thy own immortal verse,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws

a beau is but an ass,iambic,6,20,6,wswsws
and shook with indignation at the sound,iambic,6,39,7,wswswswsws
high poiz'd above his nest in air,iambic,6,33,7,wswswsws
i am to wait though waiting so be hell,iambic,6,38,9,wswswswsws
which thy own heart perhaps would better tell,iambic,6,45,8,wswswswsws
with all the fiercer tortures of the mind,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws
nothing is dead but what encumber'd gall'd,iambic,6,42,7,sswswswsws
into a perfect calm that not a breath,iambic,6,37,8,wswswswsws
to gather balm of choicest dews,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
rekindling every joy with tenfold force,iambic,6,39,6,wswsswswsws
was it in lux'ry to dissolve the span,iambic,6,37,8,wswswswsws
see'st thou the limpid current glide,iambic,6,36,6,wswswsws
whereat his horse did snort as he,iambic,6,33,7,swswswsw
his lov'd elvira grows so grave,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
nor would endure that any should controul,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
delicious draughts the quinces now or plums,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws
of ductile piety becomes their tool,iambic,6,35,6,wswswswsws
counting large heaps of o'erabounding good,iambic,6,42,6,wswswswsws
his threat'ning lance a hornet's horrid sting,iambic,6,45,7,wswswswsws
the peaceful echoes undisturb'd with sound,iambic,6,42,6,wswswswsws
when now no friendly look was left,iambic,6,34,7,wswswsws
verse in the finest mould of fancy cast,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
while as the thunder's awful sound,iambic,6,34,6,wswswsws

or in the covert of a wood,iambic,6,26,7,wswswsws
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,iambic,6,43,8,swswswwsws
and such is thine my friend intent to save,iambic,6,42,9,wswswswsws
what regions part the world of soul,iambic,6,35,7,wswswsws
what tho' the dome be wanting whose proud gate,iambic,6,46,9,wswswswsws
what sacred rapture in our bosom glows,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswsws
that wish accomplish'd why the grave of bliss,iambic,6,45,8,wswswswsws
above the reach of wild ambition's wind,iambic,6,39,7,wswswswsws
in which ten thousand thousand labours join,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws
a pestilential sow a meazel'd pork,iambic,6,34,6,wswswswsws
till from dissensions concords rise,iambic,6,35,5,wswswsws

it is his royal image makes it pass,iambic,6,35,8,wswswswsws

this said no more appear'd the beauteous maid,iambic,6,45,8,wswswswswsw
thou lately didst attempt to reach my speed,iambic,6,43,8,wswswswsws
with temperance in the rural cell,iambic,6,33,6,wswswwsws
dissolv'd in her kind arms transported lay,iambic,6,42,7,wswswswsws

while these remain a base but constant breed,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
and loudly sound ye chosen aid my people,iambic,6,40,8,wswswswswsw
are the refreshless fields their arid hue,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
while love usurp'd the tears to virtue due,iambic,6,42,8,wswswswsws
that i have luck must friend and foe confess,iambic,6,44,9,wswswswsws
prevent the axe and grace thy end,iambic,6,33,7,wswswsws
are all the nameless sweets of friendship fled,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws
where wellworn slaves obsequious to the call,iambic,6,44,7,wswswswswsw

and eat drink study sleep as it may fall,iambic,6,40,9,wswswswsws
without thy aid without thy gladsome beams,iambic,6,42,7,wswswswsws
'twas then illusion's ready hand,iambic,6,32,5,wswswsws
tow'rds the black vein a passage cleaves,iambic,6,40,7,swswswsws
while free they hung upon my pensive brow,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws

the parts all bruis'd in racking torture swell,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswwsws
are plac'd each other's beams to share,iambic,6,38,7,wswswsws
but weak of wing on planets perch'd and thought,iambic,6,47,9,wswswswsws
why from thy cheek the wonted crimson flies,iambic,6,43,8,wswswswsws
resounds for ever in th' abstracted ear,iambic,6,39,7,wswswswswsw
whose mercy deign'd to spare,iambic,6,28,5,wswsws

and prompt his talents to a better part,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
and all the great ideas fade and die,iambic,6,36,8,wswswswsws

with bashful forehead thro' the cool moist air,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws

oh would you paint his lordship's jerkin o'er,iambic,6,45,8,wswswswsws
and lye without a blush without a smile,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
while by the taper's trembling light,iambic,6,36,6,wswswswsw

the weak interpreters of mortal thoughts,iambic,6,40,6,wswswswsws
he threw his bloodstain'd sword in thunder down,iambic,6,47,8,wswswswsws
he at fit periods walks through aries,iambic,6,37,7,wswswswsws
to catch renown by ruining mankind,iambic,6,34,6,wswswswsws
and in whose life alone she seem'd to live,iambic,6,42,9,wswswswsws
to shops in crouds the dagged females fly,iambic,6,41,8,swswswsws

much better if agreeing with your own,iambic,6,37,7,wswswswsws
a nation up in arms tho' strong not proud,iambic,6,41,9,wswswswsws
is there no patron to protect the muse,iambic,6,38,8,wswswswsws
ye virgins tread with cautious feet,iambic,6,35,6,wswswsws
and cheer the anxious moments of thy end,iambic,6,40,8,wswswswsws

or where the sun with downward torrid ray,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws

or wrap himself in hamlet's inky cloak,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswsws

nor let me with a vain and idle eye,iambic,6,35,9,wswswswsws

the draught of life is mixt at best,iambic,6,35,8,wswswsws
no more shall these fond eyes delight,iambic,6,37,7,wswswsws

but just to nature own thy forming hand,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
congratulates his bliss who would not leave,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws
what then am i,iambic,6,14,4,wsws

nought like their home the constant lobsters prize,iambic,6,50,8,wswswswsws
by giving glows as on pure winter's eve,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
the bed of flora on the branch is made,iambic,6,38,9,wswswswsws
that man divine by whom were sown,iambic,6,33,7,wswswsws

drops from our locks or trickles down our face,iambic,6,46,9,wswswswsws
her rites all paid in order due,iambic,6,31,7,wswswsws

nor thou musaeus from thine ear discard,iambic,6,39,7,swswswwsws
consuming fevers rage no more,iambic,6,29,5,wswswsws
and their repeated wonders shake the dome,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
then strive no more to win a simple maid,iambic,6,40,9,wswswswsws

a court before without much state,iambic,6,33,6,wswswsws
distain'd with blood the pavement and the wall,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws

yon' shepherd idly stretch'd on the rude rock,iambic,6,45,8,wswswswsws
what charms attractive grace thy modest mien,iambic,6,44,7,wswswswsws

in vain my fluttering soul would wing its way,iambic,6,45,9,wswswswswsw

as rapt in vision dart their earnest eyes,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws

ere diff'rent mixtures left no form the same,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
thou to her friends the beauteous maid restore,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws
on her britannia's muchlov'd isle,iambic,6,33,5,wswsswsws
unmov'd they stretch themselves and longing wait,iambic,6,48,7,wswswswsws
and unsuspecting on a sister queen,iambic,6,34,6,wswswswsws
on nobler views intent the sage's mind,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswsws
though night unnumber'd worlds unfolds to view,iambic,6,46,7,wswswswsws
within your ground be seen,iambic,6,26,5,wswsws
yet still he sues with suppliant hands and eyes,iambic,6,47,9,swswswsswsw
the thin disguise of this most florid speech,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
though silent long and sleeping ne'er so sound,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws
'another year with promis'd blessings rise,iambic,6,42,6,wswswswsws
and monkish legends been their only strains,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws
her joy in gilded chariots when alive,iambic,6,37,7,wswswsswsws
to sing of nature as we pleas'd survey,iambic,6,38,8,wswswswsws
yet mark yon spectre's gloomy air,iambic,6,33,6,wswswsws
or hov'ring in the troubled air,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
beneath the frozen clod all seeds of herbs,iambic,6,42,8,wswswswsws
worse as more close the disingenuous art,iambic,6,40,7,wswswswswsw
her flow'ry chaplets on thy boughs,iambic,6,34,6,wswswsws
from well stor'd horn rich grain and timely fruits,iambic,6,50,9,wswswswsws
sweet may her fame to late remembrance bloom,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate,iambic,6,38,6,wswswswsws
nor leave remembrance of their fancy'd worth,iambic,6,44,7,wswswswsws
but beams sage horace from each strain of thine,iambic,6,47,9,wswswswsws
attuning all their passions into love,iambic,6,37,6,wswswswsws
or craggy coasts just rising into view,iambic,6,38,7,wswswswsws
with joys to honour never foes,iambic,6,30,6,wswswsws
and if selfinterest be but in the case,iambic,6,38,8,wwswswswsws
go distant shores and brighter conquests seek,iambic,6,45,7,wswswswsws
from thy behavior beauty doth he give,iambic,6,37,7,wswswswsws
yet lovelier scenes shall crown th' advancing year,iambic,6,50,8,wswswswswsws
like noah's dove my busy breast,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
no ease th' envenom'd flesh receives,iambic,6,36,6,swswswsws
till you so oft your amorous crimes repeat,iambic,6,42,8,wswswsswsws
now woo them wed them bind them to thy breast,iambic,6,45,10,wswswswsws
i spy a freckle on your brow,iambic,6,28,7,wswswsws
songs of chiefs and heroes old,iambic,6,30,6,swswsws
within augusta's walls twice have we felt,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
when the full town to joy invites,iambic,6,33,7,wswswsws
and soft as summer or the western wind,iambic,6,38,8,wswswswsws
and how to make a mighty people thrive,iambic,6,38,8,wswswswsws
where love or fancy leads,iambic,6,25,5,wswsws
the orient orb that watch'd my natal hour,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswswsw
and with thine anguish bring thy joy,iambic,6,36,7,wswswsws
that town so fam'd in lent for figs,iambic,6,35,8,wswswsws
of flattery seems so much afraid,iambic,6,32,6,wsswswsws
and schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands,iambic,6,47,8,wswswswsws
replete with heavenly love,iambic,6,26,4,wswswsw
thy various seasons in their author's mind,iambic,6,42,7,wsswswswsws
at once with dullness and with hunger curst,iambic,6,43,8,wswswswsws
what means this awful sight why round me shine,iambic,6,46,9,wswswswsws
her tender husband wond'ring much,iambic,6,33,5,wswswsws
guiltless the moments of this plain have run,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
when offer'd by the lowly meek and poor,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
with rising or with setting sun,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
trifler wilt thou sing till june,iambic,6,32,6,swswsws
is blockhead coxcomb puppy fool and sot,iambic,6,39,7,wswswswsws
to build by verse as heretofore,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
nor is so sure a bloodhound found in hell,iambic,6,41,9,wswswswsws
those plains where in unguarded hour,iambic,6,36,6,wswswswsw
the bellying sails will whiten all your channel,iambic,6,47,8,wsswswswswsw
or had he been to ton less true,iambic,6,31,8,wswswsws
unless my damon should appear,iambic,6,29,5,wswswsws
of the sole being right who spoke the word,iambic,6,42,9,wswswswsws
the heart that burns with slighted fires no more,iambic,6,48,9,wswswswswsw
but free and pure the grateful current flows,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
on blessings unenjoy'd,iambic,6,22,3,wswsws
press not for what i must deny,iambic,6,30,7,wswswsws
embolden'd will i speak my flame nor thou,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws
those real charms for which you're fam'd,iambic,6,40,7,wswswsw
he was to weet an old and wrinkled mage,iambic,6,39,9,wswswswsws
pleasures less fierce more lasting more sincere,iambic,6,47,7,sswswswsws
they hear no sound but the endearing voice,iambic,6,42,8,wswswswsws
say poyntz amidst the toils of anxious state,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
the basis on which love of glory builds,iambic,6,39,8,wswswswsws
whose stygian throats breathe darkness all day long,iambic,6,51,8,wsswswswsws
view'd in each light the simple village life,iambic,6,44,8,wswswswsws
with eyes dejected and with visage pale,iambic,6,39,7,wswswswsws
those call him loudly to pursuit of more,iambic,6,40,8,wswswswsws
in vain a powerful duty bids us part,iambic,6,36,8,wswsswswsws
the missive weapon trembl'd on the ground,iambic,6,41,7,wswswswsws
thank heaven i knew thee not i ne'er shall feel,iambic,6,47,10,wswswswswsw
to shed a tear on their vicegerents awful tomb,iambic,6,46,9,wswswswswssw
the dryads swift that roam the woods,iambic,6,36,7,wswswsws
thou fool will thy discov'ry of the cause,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws
a heart of softer workmanship than stone,iambic,6,40,7,wswswswsws
with swelling thoughts fixt on his great intent,iambic,6,47,8,wswswswsws
no language but the language of the heart,iambic,6,41,8,wswswswsws
ye thrones dominions virtues pow'rs,iambic,6,35,5,wswsswsws
why o'er this stream that deep and black appears,iambic,6,48,9,wswswswsws
then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show,iambic,6,51,10,wswswswswsws
brighteyed fancy hovering o'er,iambic,6,30,4,swswswsw
whilst i alas am left forlorn,iambic,6,29,6,wswswsws
so did azuriel's arm if fame say true,iambic,6,37,8,wswswswswsw
conduct to britain's blooming king,iambic,6,34,5,wswswsws
when heat or thirst to flowing streams invite,iambic,6,45,8,wswswswsws
and all its social cares renew,iambic,6,30,6,wswswsws
grandclimacterical absurdities,iambic,6,30,2,wswswswsws
tell me my patroness and friend,iambic,6,31,6,wswswsws
a dream while foulest foes found welcome there,iambic,6,46,8,wswswswsws
let no harsh dissonance disturb the morn,iambic,6,40,7,wswswswsws
hear this ye nymphs but hear and tremble too,iambic,6,44,9,wswswswsws
where for awhile his fond paternal care,iambic,6,39,7,wswswswsws
her scanty stock of brushwood blazing clear,iambic,6,43,7,wswswswsws
how sweet to recall the sweet moments of joy,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
'tis this and this only can absence employ,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswwswswsws
can ease my fond heart and beguile my soft pain,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
till i see with delight my dear charmer again,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsws
ah who ever knew such full transports as i,anapaestic,10,42,9,wwswswswsws
while with her the swift minutes unheeded pass'd by,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswsswswsw
alas with the sweet recollection i burn,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
bring back your delights ye dear moments return,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswssws
ah me what delights in my bosom would rise,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswwswsw
while with eager attention i've hung on her eyes,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswswswswsw
and watch'd the kind beams of compassion and love,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
while she pitied my passion and seem'd to approve,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwsswswswsws
ah me with what raptur'd attention i've hung,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
to catch the sweet accents that flow'd from her tongue,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswswsw
when tenderness bade the dear maiden impart,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswssws
the pleasing sensations that glow'd in her heart,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswswsw
o how does my fair one consume the long day,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
is the charmer quite easy while i am away,anapaestic,10,41,9,wwswsswswsws
indeed if our thoughts like our hearts should agree,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswwswswsws
the dear lovely maiden is thinking on me,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswsswswsw
ah did she but think with such fondness as i,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
how much would she grieve and how oft would she sigh,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
yet with so much fond love may her bosom ne'er burn,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswwswsw
if she fighs as i sigh if she mourns as i mourn,anapaestic,10,47,12,wswswswwswsw
but why do i wander why sigh thus alone,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswwswswsws
alas 'tis the loss of my fair that i moan,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswswswsw
why thus every hour does my sorrow increase,anapaestic,10,43,8,swsswsswwssws
alas it is absence that ruins my peace,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsw
why swells my sad bosom with fear and with grief,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswsswswsw
ah nought but her presence can bring me relief,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswwswswsws
why thus down my cheek trickles fast the big tear,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
alas can i help it my fair is not here,anapaestic,10,38,10,wswswswswsw
till i nourish'd this passion i all unconcern'd,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswsswwsws
saw peace my companion wherever i turn'd,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswsswswsw
till now with my heart all at ease i could rest,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
and a sigh was a stranger unknown to my breast,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswsswsw
what then is this love and why do i endure,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswwsws
these griefs in my mind nor endeavour to cure,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
when thus my fond heart is o'erwhelm'd with despair,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswswsws
and i know no delight when away from my fair,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswsswsw
yet colin these pains spite of all thou hast said,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
by one hour of her presence are far overpaid,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwsswwswswsws
these sorrows from absence which now you deplore,anapaestic,10,48,8,wsswswswsws
then vanish are lost and are thought of no more,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
recall those rash words and forbear to complain,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswsswsws
since the next tender meeting rewards all your pain,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswsswsw
let sweet expectation then lessen your care,anapaestic,10,43,7,swswsswswsw
let hope soften absence and keep off despair,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswswsws
sure sure those dear pleasures once more will return,anapaestic,10,52,9,wwswswswsws
how long in this absence distrest must i mourn,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
how long must i wish while my lot i deplore,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
that dear angelface could i see it once more,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswwswsw
that dear angelvoice time how swift didst thou seem,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswswsws
while i listen'd enchanted as love was her theme,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwsswswswsws
o come those dear hours and to soothe my fond pain,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
love again be her theme and i listen again,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswwswwssws
how dull and how slow do the moments retreat,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswssws
time was when they flew now there's lead on their feet,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswswsw
ye loiterers be gone why so long do ye stay,anapaestic,10,43,10,wsswswswswsw
ye fly when i'm with her ye creep when away,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswwswsws
ah colin how foolish time's progress to blame,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswsws
his paces are equal his motions the same,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
'twas the joy of her presence made time appear fleet,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswswsw
'tis the pain of her absence adds lead to his feet,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsws
it blew an hard storm and in utmost confusion,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswssw
the sailors all hurried to get absolution,anapaestic,10,41,7,wsswswswswsw
which done and the weight of the sins they'd confess'd,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswwswswsws
was transfer'd as they thought from themselves to the priest,anapaestic,10,60,10,wswswswsswsw
to lighten the ship and conclude their devotion,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsww
they toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswswswsw
as near portobello lying,trochaic,8,24,4,wswswsws
on the gently swelling flood,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
at midnight with streamers flying,trochaic,8,33,5,wswsswsw
our triumphant navy rode,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
there while vernon sate allglorious,trochaic,8,35,5,swswswsws
from the spaniards' late defeat,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
and his crews with shouts victorious,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsws
drank success to england's fleet,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
on a sudden shrilly sounding,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswswsw
hideous yells and skrieks were heard,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsw
then each heart with fear confounding,trochaic,8,37,6,wwswswsw
a sad troop of ghosts appear'd,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
all in dreary hammocks shrouded,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswswsw
which for windingsheets they wore,trochaic,8,33,5,wwswsws
and with looks by sorrow clouded,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswswsw
frowning on that hostile shore,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
on them gleam'd the moon's wan lustre,trochaic,8,37,7,wwswswsw
when the shade of hosier brave,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswswsw
his pale bands was seen to muster,trochaic,8,33,7,swswswsw
rising from their watry grave,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
o'er the glimmering wave he hy'd him,trochaic,8,36,7,swswswsws
where the burford rear'd her sail,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
with three thousand ghosts besides him,trochaic,8,38,6,swswswsw
and in groans did vernon hail,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
heed oh heed our fatal story,trochaic,8,28,6,swswswsw
i am hosier's injur'd ghost,trochaic,8,27,5,wwsswsws
you who now have purchas'd glory,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswswsw
at this place where i was lost,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
tho' in portobello's ruin,trochaic,8,25,4,wswswsws
you now triumph free from fears,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
when you think on our undoing,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswswsw
you will mix your joy with tears,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
see these mournful spectres sweeping,trochaic,8,36,5,swswswsw
ghastly o'er this hated wave,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
whose wan cheeks are stain'd with weeping,trochaic,8,41,7,swswswsw
these were english captains brave,trochaic,8,33,5,wwswsws
mark those numbers pale and horrid,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsw
those were once my failors bold,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
lo each hangs his drooping forehead,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
while his dismal tale is told,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
i by twenty sail attended,trochaic,8,25,5,wwswswsw
did this spanish town affright,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
nothing then its wealth defended,trochaic,8,32,5,swswswsw
but my orders not to fight,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
oh that in this rolling ocean,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwswsw
i had cast them with disdain,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
and obey'd my heart's warm motion,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
to have quell'd the pride of spain,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
for resistance i could fear none,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
but with twenty ships had done,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
what thou brave and happy vernon,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswswsw
hast atchiev'd with six alone,trochaic,8,29,5,wsswsws
then the bastimentos never,trochaic,8,26,4,wwswswsw
had our foul dishonour seen,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
nor the sea the sad receiver,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswswsw
of this gallant train had been,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
thus like thee proud spain dismaying,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsw
and her galleons leading home,trochaic,8,29,5,wwsswsws
though condemn'd for disobeying,trochaic,8,31,4,swswswsw
i had met a traitor's doom,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
to have fallen my country crying,trochaic,8,32,6,wwsswswsw
he has play'd an english part,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
had been better far than dying,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswswsw
of a griev'd and broken heart,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
unrepining at thy glory,trochaic,8,23,4,swswswsw
thy successful arms we hail,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
but remember our sad story,trochaic,8,26,5,swswswsw
and let hosier's wrongs prevail,trochaic,8,31,5,swsswsws
sent in this foul clime to languish,trochaic,8,35,7,swswswsw
think what thousands fell in vain,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
wasted with disease and anguish,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
not in glorious battle slain,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
hence with all my train attending,trochaic,8,33,6,wswwswsw
from their oozy tombs below,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
thro' the hoary foam ascending,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
here i feed my constant woe,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
here the bastimentos viewing,trochaic,8,28,4,wwswswsw
we recal our shameful doom,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
and our plaintive cries renewing,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswswsw
wander thro' the midnight gloom,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
o'er these waves for ever mourning,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswswsw
shall we roam depriv'd of rest,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
if to britain's shores returning,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswswsw
you neglect my just request,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
after this proud foe subduing,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
when your patriot friends you see,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswswsw
think on vengeance for my ruin,trochaic,8,30,6,swswswsw
and for england sham'd in me,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
then sleep for an hour or two and no more,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswwswswsws
at nine stretch your arms and oh think when alone,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
there's no pleasure in bed mary bring me my gown,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswswswswsw
slip on that ere you rise let your caution be such,anapaestic,10,50,11,swswswswssww
keep all cold from your breast there's already too much,anapaestic,10,55,10,swswswswswsw
your pinners set right your twitcher ty'd on,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsw
your prayers at an end and your breakfast quite done,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsw
retire to some author improving and gay,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
and with sense like your own set your mind for the day,anapaestic,10,54,12,wwswswswswsw
at twelve you may walk for at this time o' the year,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswwswswswsw
the sun like your wit is as mild as 'tis clear,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
but mark in the meadows the ruin of time,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswsswswsw
take the hint and let life be improv'd in its prime,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsws
return not in haste nor of dressing take heed,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
for beauty like yours no assistance can need,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
with an appetite thus down to dinner you sit,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw
where the chief of the feast is the flow of your wit,anapaestic,10,52,12,wswswswwswsw
let this be indulg'd and let laughter go round,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
as it pleases your mind to your health 'twill redound,anapaestic,10,53,10,wwswswswswsw
after dinner two glasses at least i approve,anapaestic,10,43,8,swsswswswsws
name the first to the king and the last to your love,anapaestic,10,52,12,wswswswwswsw
thus cheerful with wisdom with innocence gay,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
and calm with your joys gently glide thro' the day,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
the dews of the evening most carefully shun,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
then in chat or at play with a dance or a song,anapaestic,10,46,12,wswswswwswsw
let the night like the day pass with pleasure along,anapaestic,10,51,10,swswswswssws
all cares but of love banish far from your mind,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
and those you may end when you please to be kind,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
shepherd seek not wealth nor power,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsw
let the verdant woodbine bower,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
and the hills and vales and trees,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw

alexis the pride of the plain,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
beside a clear brook lay reclin'd,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
his complaint was fair daphne's disdain,anapaestic,10,39,6,swswswsws
who had prov'd to the shepherd unkind,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswssws
his flock was no longer his care,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsw
his pipe now no longer could please,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
he neglected his dress and his hair,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
and by solitude fed his disease,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswsws
poor shepherd he wildly exclaim'd,anapaestic,10,33,5,wswswsws
alas what avails all thy moan,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
the joys thy fond fancy had fram'd,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsw
with daphne for ever are flown,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
how could you o daphne deceive,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
a swain not unworthy your love,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsw
why didst thou alexis believe,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
such a maid could thy passion approve,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswssws
her form is replete with each grace,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
the diamond beams forth in her eye,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
the lily expands o'er her face,anapaestic,10,30,6,wsswswsw
and the rosebud imparts its soft dye,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
no warbler can rival her song,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
philomela with envy complains,anapaestic,10,29,4,swswswsws
the streams glide in silence along,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswssws
the glad zephyrs diffuse her soft strains,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswswsws
when daphne appear'd in the mead,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
her presence enliven'd the morn,anapaestic,10,31,5,wsswswsw
now the winds roughly blow round my head,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsw
and the sun's chearful beams are withdrawn,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswsws
no longer these meadows look green,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
now the warblers abandon the grove,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
the air breathes no longer serene,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
all summer is fled with my love,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
oh daphne you heard my fond sighs,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
you did not my passion disdain,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
when i gaz'd with delight on your eyes,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
my soft glances you did not restrain,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
but now you make sport of my woes,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
and laugh at the sufferings i feel,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
i enjoy not the sweets of repose,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsws
nor can i my torments conceal,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
farewell ye sad scenes of my love,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
i shall never revisit you more,anapaestic,10,30,6,wwsswswsw
adieu to the mead an he grove,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
'twas here i first learn'd to adore,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
i will banish this wretch from her sight,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
i know not what fate may ensue,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
never more can i taste of delight,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
to every enjoyment adieu,anapaestic,10,24,4,wswswssws
with a torrent of heartbursting grief,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswsws
alexis continues his moan,anapaestic,10,25,4,wswswsws
tears gave him some little relief,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwssws
yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
pastora by chance hasten'd by,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
she saw the poor shepherd's despair,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswssws
soft pity appear'd in her eye,anapaestic,10,29,6,wsswswsw
she ask'd him the source of his care,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
what cause has alexis to weep,anapaestic,10,29,6,swswswsw
with looks of compassion she said,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsw
have you lost e'er a lamb or a sheep,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
or is tray the poor favourite dead,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
or perhaps your fair daphne's unkind,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
perhaps for her coyness you grieve,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswwswsw
ah 'tis jealousy poisons your mind,anapaestic,10,34,6,swsswswsw
but appearances often deceive,anapaestic,10,29,4,swswswsws
the shepherd just rais'd up his head,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
he thank'd the kind maid for her care,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
he confess'd that all comfort was fled,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
and nothing was left but despair,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
pastora e'en wept at the tale,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswswsw
and wish'd she could ease his distress,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
could her interest with daphne prevail,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
his suffering should soon find redress,anapaestic,10,38,6,wsswswsws
he gaz'd on the fair with surprize,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
and admir'd the goodnature she shew'd,anapaestic,10,37,6,swsswswsws
when she went he withdrew not his eyes,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
but with pleasure her footsteps pursu'd,anapaestic,10,39,6,swswswsws
her sweetness her beauty and truth,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
with daphne's late falshood compar'd,anapaestic,10,36,5,wswswsws
so charm'd so astonish'd the youth,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsw
that his heart for a change was prepar'd,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
yet still his fond wish would arise,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
ah was but my daphne thus kind,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
i would wipe off these tears from my eyes,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
and give up my sighs to the wind,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
he said and arose from the ground,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
then instant return'd to his cot,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
soon in sleep every suffering was drown'd,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswsswswsws
and daphne's unkindness forgot,anapaestic,10,30,4,wswswsws
with the sun the next morn he arose,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
pastora he sought in the grove,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
he repeated the tale of his woes,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsws
and mourn'd the sad fate of his love,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
pastora heard every complaint,anapaestic,10,29,4,swswswsws
again he imparted his grief,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswswsws
he talk'd without fear or constraint,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
and found from her converse relief,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
the friendship he felt for the fair,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
each meeting still serv'd to improve,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
he then blest his late cause of despair,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
and became a true votary to love,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsws
'twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
he no longer to merit was blind,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsws
'twas his joy and a laudable pride,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
that he valu'd the charms of the mind,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
pastora with blushes confest,anapaestic,10,28,4,wswswsws
that she felt all the force of true love,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
but that reason her passion supprest,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
yet that now she must own and approve,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
she soon gave her hand to the swain,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
who proclaim'd to each shepherd this truth,anapaestic,10,42,7,swswswsws
he had met a reward for his pain,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
more lasting than beauty and youth,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswswsw
when spring decks with verdure the mead,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsw
love wafts milder fragrance around,anapaestic,10,34,5,swswssws
when summer invites to the shade,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
love strews with fresh flowrets the ground,anapaestic,10,42,7,swswswsw
in autumn thro' cornfields they rove,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
and their loves as in springtime appear,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
tho' winter disrobes the known grove,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
yet their love varies not with the year,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
ye nymphs to this maxim attend,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
tho' beauty awhile may allure,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
yet to fix in the lover the friend,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
'tis virtue alone is secure,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswswsws
ye swains who are caught by a face,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
know that beauty will quickly decay,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
that virtue still heightens each grace,anapaestic,10,38,6,wswswsws
and imparts more than time steals away,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
on the banks of that crystalline stream,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswsw
where thames oft his current delays,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
and charms more than poets can dream,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswwswsw
in his richmond's bright villa surveys,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
fair ella of all the gay throng,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
the fairest that nature had seen,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
now drew every village along,anapaestic,10,28,5,swsswssws
from the day she first danc'd on the green,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswsws
ah boast not of beauty's fond power,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswwswsw
for short is the triumph ye fair,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswwswsw
not fleeter the bloom of each flower,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsw
and hope is but gilded despair,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
his affection each swain now behold,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
by riches endeavours to prove,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswswsw
but ella still cries what is gold,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
or wealth when compar'd to his love,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
yes allen together we'll wield,anapaestic,10,30,5,wsswswsw
our sickles in summer's bright day,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswswsw
together we'll lease o'er the field,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
and smile all our labours away,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
in winter i'll winnow the wheat,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
as it falls from thy flail on the ground,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
that flail will be music as sweet,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
when thy voice in the labour is drown'd,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
how oft would he speak of his bliss,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
how oft would he call her his maid,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
and allen would seal with a kiss,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
every promise and vow that he said,anapaestic,10,34,7,sswswswsws
but hark o'er the grasslevelc land,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswwswsw
the village bells sound on the plain,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
false allen this morn gave his hand,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
and ella's sond tears are in vain,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
sad ella too soon heard the tale,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
too soon the sad cause she was told,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
that his was a nymph of the vale,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
that he broke his sond promise for gold,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
as she walk'd by the margin so green,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
which befringes the sweet river's side,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
how oft' was she languishing seen,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
how oft' would she gaze on the tide,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
by the clear river then as she sate,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
which reflected herself and the mead,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
awhile she bewept her sad fate,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
and the green turf still pillow'd her head,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswsw
there there is it ella i see,anapaestic,10,28,7,wwswswsw
'tis ella the lost undone maid,anapaestic,10,30,6,wsswswsw
ah no 'tis some ella like me,anapaestic,10,28,7,swswswsw
some hapless young virgin betray'd,anapaestic,10,34,5,wswswsws
like me she has sorrow'd and wept,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
like me she has fondly believ'd,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
like me her true promise she kept,anapaestic,10,33,7,wwswswsw
and like me too is justly deceiv'd,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
i come dear companion in grief,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsw
gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswssws
i come and we'll gather relief,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
from bosoms so chaste and so true,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
like you i have mourn'd the long night,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
and wept out the day in despair,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
like you i have banish'd delight,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswwssws
and bosom'd a friend in my care,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
ye meadows so lovely farewel,anapaestic,10,28,5,wsswswsw
your velvet still allen shall tread,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
all deaf to the sound of that knell,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
which tolls for his ella when dead,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
your wish will too sure be obey'd,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
nor allen her loss shall bemoan,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
soon soon shall poor ella be laid,anapaestic,10,33,7,wwswswsw
where her heart shall be cold as your own,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
then twin'd in the arms of that fair,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
whose wealth has been ella's sad fate,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswwswsw
as together ye draw the free air,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsws
and a thousand dear pleasures relate,anapaestic,10,36,6,wwsswssws
if chance o'er my turf as ye tread,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
ye dare to affect a fond sigh,anapaestic,10,29,7,swswswsw
the primrose will shrink her pale head,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
and the violet languish and die,anapaestic,10,31,6,wwsswswsw
ah weep not fond maid 'tis in vain,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
like the tears which you lend to the stream,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswsws
tears are lost in that watery plain,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
and your sighs are still lost upon him,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
scarce echo had gather'd the sound,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswswsw
but she plung'd from her grassspringing bed,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswsw
the liquid stream parts to the ground,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
and the mirror clos'd over her head,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwsswswsw
the swains of the village at eve,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswwswsw
oft meet at the darkspreading yew,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
there wonder how man could deceive,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
a bosom so chaste and so true,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
with garlands of every flower,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswsswsw
which ella herself should have made,anapaestic,10,35,6,wsswswsw
they raise up a shortliving bower,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
and sighing cry peace to her shade,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
then handlock'dinhand as they move,anapaestic,10,34,5,wswswsws
the greenplatting hillock around,anapaestic,10,32,4,wswswsws
they talk of poor ella and love,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsw
and freshen with tears the fair ground,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
nay wish they had never been born,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
or liv'd the sad moment to view,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsw
when her allen could thus be forsworn,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
and his ella could still be so true,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
in the dead of the night when with labour oppress'd,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswssws
all mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
cupid knock'd at my door i awoke with the noise,anapaestic,10,47,10,swswswswswsw
and who is it i call'd that my sleep thus destroys,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswwswswsws
you need not be frighten'd he answered mild,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswsswsws
let me in i'm a little unfortunate child,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswsswswsw
'tis a dark rainy night and i'm wet to the skin,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswwswsw
and my way i have lost and do pray let me in,anapaestic,10,44,12,wswswswswsww
i was mov'd with compassion and striking a light,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswsswswsw
i open'd the door when a boy stood in sight,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
who had wings on his shoulders the rain from him dripp'd,anapaestic,10,56,11,wwswwswswsws
with a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswwswswsws
i stirr'd up my fire and close by its side,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
i set him down by me with napkins i dried,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswswswsw
i chaf'd him all over kept out the cold air,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
and i wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswswwsw
he from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswswswswsw
but taking his bow up he said if you please,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
we will try it i would by experiment know,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswwswswsw
if the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswsswswsw
forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswsswswsw
to the string he apply'd it and twang went the yew,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwswsw
the arrow was gone in my bosom it center'd,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswsswsw
no sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswswsw
away skipp'd the urchin as brisk as a bee,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
and laughing i wish you much joy friend quoth he,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
my bow is undamag'd for true went the dart,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswsswswsw
but you will have trouble enough with your heart,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsw
sue venal belinda to grant you the blessing,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswwsw
as jove courted danae or vain's your addressing,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsw
for love she asserts all that's generous inspires,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswssws
and therefore rich tokens of love she requires,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswwswswsw
such suitors as nothing but ardours are boasting,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswsswsw
will ne'er reach elysium but ever be coasting,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswsswsswsw
like pennyless ghosts deny'd passage by charon,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswsswsw
they'll find without fee unrelenting the fair one,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsws
but give me the nymph not ungrateful to wooing,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswssw
who love pays with love and caresses with cooing,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswsswsw
by whom a true heart is accepted as sterling,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswssw
and cupid alone makes her lover her darling,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsswsw
ye myrtles and woodbines so green,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
ye bow'rs that with rapture i've seen,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswwswsw
when his heart beat with every look,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
when he left both his pipe and his crook,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
each hour he employ'd for his dear,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
the sweet bryar and violet did rear,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
with roses and hiacynths fair,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswswsw
sweet chaplets he wove for her hair,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
at noon's scorching heat we retir'd,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
or else to the wood he admir'd,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswswsw
with his song did the shepherd delight,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswssws
my steps did the charmer invite,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
but ah to my sorrow i find,anapaestic,10,26,7,wswwswsw
that damon is false as the wind,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
with scorn doth he slight all my charms,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswsws
with hatred he flies from my arms,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
the garland he wove for my hair,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
the crook that he bought at the fair,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
the bow'r which for delia he made,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
of the grot and the silver cascade,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
my flocks can no longer delight,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
for when damon is out of my sight,anapaestic,10,33,8,swswswsws
no more do i sport on the plain,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswsws
'till damon doth pity my pain,anapaestic,10,29,6,wsswswsw
when phoebus was am'rous and long'd to be rude,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
miss daphne cry'd pish and ran swift to the wood,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
and rather than do such a naughty affair,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
she became a fine laurel to deck the god's hair,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsws
the nymph was no doubt of a cold constitution,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswswsw
for sure to turn tree was an odd resolution,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswswsw
yet in this she behav'd like a true modern spouse,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswssw
for she fled from his arms to distinguish his brows,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswswsw
my lord of killala i find to my sorrow,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswsswswwsw
i can't have the honour i hop'd for tomorrow,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswswsw
but why i'm so wretched my friend must rehearse,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswwswswsws
for i never can write my vexations in verse,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
disappointments are sent to poor mortals to show,anapaestic,10,48,8,swswswswswsw
'tis in vain to expect to be happy below,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswwssws
yet you've a fair prospect it must be confess'd,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwswswswsws
who with fortune and station and delia are bless'd,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswsswswsw
with delia whose soul is so fitted for you,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
who shares with such pleasure the good which you do,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswsws
who visits your see with far other designs,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswssws
than conning your rentrolls and raising your fines,anapaestic,10,50,8,wswswswswsw
no longer let rome her old argument boast,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
that by marriage the end of the priesthood is lost,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
that toil'd and entangled in family cares,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswswsw
the clergy forget their celestial affairs,anapaestic,10,41,6,wswswswswsw
for had she known delia she must have confess'd,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwswswswsws
that the church in the marriage of prelates was bless'd,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswsswswsw
and auld robin forbes hes gien tem a dance,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswswsw
i pat on my speckets to see them aw prance,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
i thout o' the days when i was but fifteen,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
and skipp'd wi' the best upon forbes's green,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswsws
of aw things that is i think thout is meast queer,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
it brings that that's bypast and sets it down here,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswwswswsws
i see willy as plain as i dui this bit leace,anapaestic,10,44,11,swswswswswswsw
when he tuik his cwoat lappet and deeghted his feace,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswswwsswswsw
the lasses aw wonder'd what willy cud see,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
in yen that was dark and hard featur'd leyke me,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
and they wonder'd ay mair when they talk'd o' my wit,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
and slily telt willy that cudn't be it,anapaestic,10,38,8,wsswsswswsw
but willy he laugh'd and he meade me his weyfe,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
and whea was mair happy thro' aw his lang leyfe,anapaestic,10,47,10,swswsswswsw
it's e'en my great comfort now willy is geane,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswwsw
that he offen said nea pleace was leyke his awn heame,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
i mind when i carried my wark to yon steyle,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
where willy was deykin the time to beguile,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswswswsws
he wad fling me a daisy to put i' my breast,anapaestic,10,43,11,wswswsswswsw
and i hammer'd my noddle to mek out a jest,anapaestic,10,42,10,wwsswswswsws
but merry or grave willy often wad tell,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
there was nin o' the leave that was leyke my awn sel,anapaestic,10,52,12,wwswswswswsw
and he spak what he thout for i'd hardly a plack,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswwswsw
when we married and nobbet ae gown to my back,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwsswswswsws
when the clock had struck eight i expected him heame,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswswswswsw
and wheyles went to meet him as far as dumleane,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
of aw hours it telt eight was dearest to me,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
but now when it streykes there's a tear i' my ee,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
o willy dear willy it never can be,anapaestic,10,34,8,wsswsswswsw
that age time or death can divide thee and me,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
for that spot on earth that's aye dearest to me,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
is the turf that has cover'd my willy frae me,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswsswswsw
by the lyre of apollo the locks of the muses,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswsswswwsw
and the pure lucid stream aganippe produces,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswwswsw
my ellis i love thee then pay me in kind,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswswsw
let the thought of a friend never slip from your mind,anapaestic,10,53,11,swswswswswsw
so may fancy and judgment together combine,anapaestic,10,42,7,wwswswswswsw
and the bosom be fill'd with an ardor divine,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw
that thy brows may the laurel with justice still claim,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswswwsw
and the temple of liberty mount thee to fame,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswsswswsw
if it e'er can give pleasure to know my career,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
when proud london i left with intentions so queer,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswswsw
accept it in verse on the very first day,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswswsw
when the queen of warm passions precedes the fair may,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswsswswsw
when so custom prescribes and to follow old rules,anapaestic,10,49,9,swsswswwswsw
one half of mankind makes the other half fools,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
from the town i first breath'd in i sally'd in haste,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
thro' highgate and finchley and barnet i pass'd,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
at st alban's i din'd with a laughing gay crew,anapaestic,10,46,10,swswswswswsw
not complete was the set without tucker and you,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswssww
where the eighth of our harries deserted his mate,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswswsw
and procur'd a full sentence against his old kate,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswswsw
our brisk company supp'd while our wine gave a spring,anapaestic,10,53,10,swswswswswsw
and tho' at the crown we ne'er thought of the king,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
the morrow succeeding i got from my bed,anapaestic,10,39,8,wsswswswsws
as a sheet all the roads were with snows overspread,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswwswswsws
but the gods who will never abandon a poet,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswsswswsww
as oft has been said condescended to show it,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsws
in a coach and six horses the storm i defy'd,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsws
and left by my friends thro' the tempest i ride,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
newportpannel receiv'd me and gave me a dinner,anapaestic,10,46,8,swsswswwswwsw
and a bed at northampton was press'd by a sinner,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswswsw
no signs of fair weather the west chester coach,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswssw
at nine the next morning a welcome approach,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswwswswsws
presents fresh example i travell'd all day,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
at crick eat my dinner at coventry lay,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswsswswsw
i tremble whene'er i reflect on the roads,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
that lead to those dirty wormeaten abodes,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswwswswsws
where a woman rode naked their taxes to clear,anapaestic,10,45,9,swsswsswswsw
and a taylor for peeping paid damnably dear,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswswsw
for two parliaments fam'd which intail a disgrace,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswswswswsw
and have left their foul manners to poison the place,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswswsw
next morning the fun with a face of red hue,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
had clear'd up th' expanse and array'd it in blue,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswsswsw
when i left the vile town 'gainst which ever i'll rail,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswsw
while meriden offers no humble regale,anapaestic,10,37,6,wsswswswsws
but near mixal park din'd at house of mean fame,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswsws
and at night to the field of slain carcasses came,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
tho' full old are thy tow'rs yet receive my just praise,anapaestic,10,55,11,swswswswswsw
may thy ale be recorded and live in my lays,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsws
thy gothic cathedral new homage still claims,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
nor refuse i thy due tho' repair'd by king james,anapaestic,10,48,10,wsswswswswsw
i forgot to advise you the sky being clear,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsws
'twas at coventry first i ascended my chair,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswswswsw
but alas on the morrow how dismal the sight,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswwsswswsw
for the day had assum'd all the horrors of night,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswwswsw
the clouds their gay visage had chang'd to a frown,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswsswswsw
and in a white mantle cloath'd litchfield's old town,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswswsw
but at noon all was o'er when intrepid and bold,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswwswswsw
as a trainband commander or falstaff of old,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswswsw
and proudly defying the wind and the snow,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
when the danger was pass'd i determin'd to go,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswswsw
at stone i repos'd but at ousley i din'd,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswswsw
when our reck'ning was cheap and the landlord was kind,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswsw
next morning we sally'd and staffordshire lost,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswswsw
but not ill entertain'd by a cestrian host,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswwswsw
on the banks of the wever at namptwich renown'd,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwswwswswsws
for an excellent brine pit our dinner we found,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswswsw
the wine was not bad tho' the ale did displease,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
and an unctuous desert was serv'd up of old cheese,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswwsw
but as time will not tarry our course we resume,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswwswswsws
and st george's dragoons take their seats in our room,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswswsws
so travelling onwards with pleasure we see,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
old caerleon so famous o'er looking the dee,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswsswswsw
four days there we rested and blithsome and gay,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswsw
forgot the bad weather we met on the way,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswswsw
then old chester farewel till i see thee again,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswsswswsws
and can stroll thro' thy streets without dreading the rain,anapaestic,10,58,10,wswswswswwsw
may thy river still swell better pleas'd with his charge,anapaestic,10,56,10,wwswswswswsw
than when edgar was row'd by eight kings in his barge,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
be the maidens all virtuous who drink of thy tide,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwsswswswswsw
and each virgin in bloom be affianc'd a bride,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswswsw
may the heart and the hand at the altar be join'd,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
and no matron complain that a husband's unkind,anapaestic,10,46,8,swsswswwswsw
let their bounty to strangers refound in each song,anapaestic,10,50,9,swswswswswsw
be barnstone their copy they cannot go wrong,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
o'er the cuts of the river our tract we pursue,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswwswswsws
and old flint in the prospect now rises to view,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswsswswsw
how strange to behold here our language is fled,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
to converse with these people's to talk to the dead,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsws
and a turk or chinese is as well understood,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsws
by these roisters who boast of cadwalladar's blood,anapaestic,10,50,8,wwsswswswsws
as an englishman here who is certainly undone,anapaestic,10,45,8,wwswswswswsws
if he thinks to make use of the language of london,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwswssw
from flint we depart with our landlord and guide,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswwswsw
who show'd us that kindness which courts never try'd,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswwswswsws
the castle where richard his grandeur laid down,anapaestic,10,47,8,wsswswswsws
and betray'd his own life by surrend'ring the crown,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswswswsw
now the well we survey where a virgin of old,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswwswsw
to all flame but religion's was lifeless and cold,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswswsw
when in vain princely cradoc had offer'd his bed,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswsswswsw
the merciless heathen e'en chopp'd off her head,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswsswswswsw
hence the stones are distain'd with the colour of blood,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswwswsw
and each cripple is cur'd who will bathe in the flood,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
thus the rankest absurdity brain can conceive,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswswswsws
superstition imposes and crowds will believe,anapaestic,10,44,6,swsswswswsws
turn from legends and nonsense to see a gay sight,anapaestic,10,49,10,swsswswswsws
where the meadows of clewyn the senses delight,anapaestic,10,46,8,wwsswswswsws
and excuse that i aim not to point out the place,anapaestic,10,48,11,swswwswwswsw
lest my numbers too lowly the landscape disgrace,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswsswswsw
at rhydland we dine and a castle we view,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswswsw
whose founder i'd name if the founder i knew,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
but our host gives the word and we hurry away,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswswswswsw
lest the length of the journey outrun the short day,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswsswsw
now ascend penmenrose oh beware as you rise,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsswsw
what a prospect of horror what dreadful surprize,anapaestic,10,48,8,wwsswswswsws
see that height more sublime which no footsteps e'er try'd,anapaestic,10,58,10,wswswswsswsw
there the ocean roars loudly how awful his pride,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswswswswsw
how narrow the path observe where you tread,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsws
nor stumble the feet nor grow dizzy the head,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
if you slip not mankind can avert your sad doom,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
dash'd against the rough rocks and the sea for your tomb,anapaestic,10,56,11,swswswswswsw
the danger is past and now conway's broad beech,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
fatigu'd and dismay'd with great gladness we reach,anapaestic,10,50,8,wswswswswsw
in a leaky old boat we were wafted safe o'er,anapaestic,10,44,10,wwswswswswsw
tho' two drunkards our steersmen to th' opposite shore,anapaestic,10,54,9,wswswsswswswsw
here the town and the river are both of a name,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswsswswsw
and boast the first edward who rais'd her to fame,anapaestic,10,49,10,swswsswswsw
there a supper was order'd which no one could touch,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwsswswswsws
this too little was boil'd and that roasted too much,anapaestic,10,52,10,swsswswwswsw
to his chamber full hungry each pilgrim retreats,anapaestic,10,48,8,wwswswswswsw
and forgets his lost meal 'twixt a pair of welch sheets,anapaestic,10,55,11,swswswswswsw
a castle hard by i with pleasure behold,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswssws
which kings had long dwelt in or giants of old,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
but the daw and each nightbird now builds up her nest,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswwswswsws
and with clamours and shrieks the old mansion infest,anapaestic,10,52,9,wwswswswswsw
we waken'd at four and our host left us here,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
as the worst ways were past so but small was our fear,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
we follow'd our route and cross'd penmenmaur'sside,anapaestic,10,50,7,wswswswswsw
where the prudent will walk but the bolder will ride,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswswswswsw
still above us old rocks seem to threaten a fall,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswswswswsw
and present to spectators the form of a wall,anapaestic,10,44,9,wsswswswswsw
now bangor we reach oh if e'er thou hadst fame,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
tho' lawn sleeves thou bestow'st on my life 'tis a shame,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswswwswsw
there we cross o'er an arm of the sea and carouse,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswwswswsws
on the opposite shore at an excellent house,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswswsw
thro' anglesea's island we rattle our chaise,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswsswswsw
while the goats all in wonder seem on us to gaze,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswwsw
for be pleas'd to observe and with diligence note,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswwswsw
that 'twas here first in wales that i met with a goat,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
o'er roads rough and craggy our journey we sped,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswsw
nor baited again 'till we reach'd holyhead,anapaestic,10,42,7,wsswswswsws
the next day at noon in the wyndham we sail,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
and the packet danc'd brisk with a prosperous gale,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswswswsw
we at ten past the bar in the wherry confin'd,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswwssws
which swims on no water and sails with no wind,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
'till near two we sate cursing in vain they may row,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsws
not a snail is so sluggish nor tortoise so slow,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswsswswsw
'till a boat took us in and at length set us down,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswswsww
at the quay of st george in st patrick's chief town,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswsw
thence i wrote to my friend nor believe what those say,anapaestic,10,54,11,swswswswswsw
or too fond to find fault or too wantonly gay,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswswswsw
who with taunts contumelious this island o'erload,anapaestic,10,49,7,wswswswswswsw
as with bogs and with blunders and nonsense full stow'd,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswsswsw
for believe me they live not unbless'd with good air,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswswswsw
and their daughters are beauteous and sons debonair,anapaestic,10,51,8,wwswsswswsws
here tho' bacchus too often displays his red face,anapaestic,10,49,9,swsswswsswsw
yet minerva he holds in the strictest embrace,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswswswswsw
nor the maiden is coy ev'ry charm to resign,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
and the ivy and laurel peep forth from the vine,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwsswswswsws
thus i've told you in verse the whole progress i took,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswsws
as true as if sworn in full court on the book,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswswsw
let me know how in london you measure your time,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswwsw
'twill be welcome in prose but twice welcome in rhyme,anapaestic,10,53,10,swswswswswsw
tho' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
what all must confess to be rare,anapaestic,10,32,7,wwswswsw
a female still chearful and faithful and kind,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswwswswsw
the blessings of autumn to share,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswsswswsw
overspread with its branches and shade,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
whose clusters appear more transparent and fine,anapaestic,10,47,7,wswswswswsw
as its leaves are beginning to sade,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
when the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load,anapaestic,10,57,11,wswswswswwsw
in our orchard surrounded with pales,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
in a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd,anapaestic,10,48,11,wwswswswswsw
for a tart that in winter regales,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
when the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
seem to hang on its surface like smoak,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
'till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn,anapaestic,10,51,10,swswswswswsw
within doors let us prattle and joke,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsw
but when we see clear all the hues of the leaves,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
and at work in the fields are all hands,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves,anapaestic,10,52,9,wwswswswswsw
let us carelesly stroll o'er the lands,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsw
how pleasing the sight of the toiling they make,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
to collect what kind nature has sent,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
heaven grant we may not of their labour partake,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswssws
but oh give us their happy content,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
and sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswsswswsw
let us silently sit at our ease,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsws
and there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook,anapaestic,10,54,12,wswswswwswsw
struggles hard to procure its release,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswsws
and now when the husbandman sings harvest home,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswwswswsws
and the corn's all got into the house,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
when the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswwswsw
to frolic and feast and carouse,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
when the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswsswsw
and are leaving the branches all bare,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
either strew'd at the roots shrivell'd wither'd and dead,anapaestic,10,56,9,swswswswswsw
or else blown to and fro in the air,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswwswswswsw
and the axletree's ready to break,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
while the waggoner whistles in stopping his team,anapaestic,10,48,8,swsswsswswsw
and then claps the poor jades on the neck,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
in the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswsswswsw
or the fearful young covey beset,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswsws
which tho' skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswsswswsw
are becoming a prey to the net,anapaestic,10,30,7,swswswsws
let's enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords,anapaestic,10,47,7,wswswsswswsws
still amus'd with these innocent sports,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswsw
nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords,anapaestic,10,47,10,swswswswswsw
with their grand entertainments in courts,anapaestic,10,41,6,wswswswsw
in the evening when lovers are leaning on stiles,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswsswswsw
deep engag'd in some amorous chat,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
and 'tis very well known by his grin and her smiles,anapaestic,10,51,11,swsswswwswsw
what they both have a mind to be at,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
to our dwelling tho' homely wellpleas'd to repair,anapaestic,10,49,8,wwsswswswsws
let our mutual endearments revive,anapaestic,10,33,5,swswswssws
and let no single action or look but declare,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsws
how contented and happy we live,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswsws
should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswwswsw
let soft music the phantoms remove,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
for 'tis harmony only has force to controul,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswssw
and unite all the passions in love,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
with her eyes but half open her cap all awry,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsws
when the lass is preparing for bed,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
and the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
sometimes rouzes and scratches his head,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswsw
in the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy and dark,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswsswswsw
and the labourers snore as they lie,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswsswsw
in the farm or the village hard by,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
at the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswwswsw
ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsws
which the sunshine and daylight forbids,anapaestic,10,39,6,swswswsws
a female still cheerful and faithful and kind,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
as its leaves are beginning to fade,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
seem to hang on its surface like smoke,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
let us carelesly strole o'er the lands,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsw
hark hark 'tis a voice from the tomb,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
come lucy it cries come away,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
the grave of thy colin has room,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
to rest thee beside his cold clay,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
i come my dear shepherd i come,anapaestic,10,30,7,swswswsw
ye friends and companions adieu,anapaestic,10,31,5,swswssws
i haste to my colin's dark home,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
to die on his bosom so true,anapaestic,10,27,7,wswwswsw
all mournful the midnight bell rung,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
when lucy sad lucy arose,anapaestic,10,24,5,wswswsws
and forth to the green turf she sprung,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
where colin's pale ashes repose,anapaestic,10,31,5,wsswssws
all wet with the night's chilling dew,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
her bosom embrac'd the cold ground,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswswsw
while stormy winds over her blew,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
and nightravens croak'd all around,anapaestic,10,34,5,wswswsws
how long my lov'd colin she cry'd,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
how long must thy lucy complain,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
how long shall the grave my love hide,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
how long ere it join us again,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
for thee thy fond shepherdess liv'd,anapaestic,10,35,6,wwswswsw
with thee o'er the world would she fly,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
for thee has she sorrow'd and griev'd,anapaestic,10,37,7,wwswswsw
for thee would she lie down and die,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
alas what avails it how dear,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
thy lucy was once to her swain,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
her face like the lily so fair,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
and eyes that gave light to the plain,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
the shepherd that lov'd her is gone,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
that face and those eyes charm no more,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
and lucy forgot and alone,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswswsws
to death shall her colin deplore,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswwssws
while thus she lay sunk in despair,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
and mourn'd to the echoes around,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswwssws
inflam'd all at once grew the air,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
and thunder shook dreadful the ground,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswswsws
i hear the kind call and obey,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
o colin receive me she cried,anapaestic,10,28,6,wsswswsw
then breathing a groan o'er his clay,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
she hung on his tombstone and died,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
ye shepherds so careless and gay,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
who sport with the nymphs of the plain,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
take heed lest you frolic away,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
the peace you can never regain,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
let not folly your bosoms annoy,anapaestic,10,31,6,swsswssws
and of love the dear mischief beware,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
you may think 'tis all sunshine and joy,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
i know 'its o'ershadow'd with care,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
love's morning how blithsome it shines,anapaestic,10,38,6,wswswsws
with an aspect deceitfully fair,anapaestic,10,31,5,wwsswswsw
its day oft in sorrow declines,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswssws
and it sets in the night of despair,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
hope paints the gay scene to the sight,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
while fancy her visions bestows,anapaestic,10,31,5,wswswsws
and gilds every dream with delight,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
but to wake us to sensible woes,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswswsw
how hard is my lot to complain,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
of a nymph whom i yet must adore,anapaestic,10,32,8,swswswsws
tho' she love not her shepherd again,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswssws
her damon must love her the more,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
for it was not the pride of her sex,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
that treated his vows with disdain,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
for it was not the pleasure to vex,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
that made her delude her fond swain,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
'twas his the fair nymph to behold,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
he hop'd and he rashly believ'd,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
'twas hers to be fatally cold,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswwswsw
he lov'd and was fondly deceiv'd,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
for such is of lovers the doom,anapaestic,10,30,7,wwswswsw
while passions their reason beguile,anapaestic,10,35,5,wswswsws
'tis warrant enough to presume,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
if they catch but a look or a smile,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
yet surely my phillis would seem,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
to prize me most shepherds above,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswwssws
but that might be only esteem,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
while i foolishly construed it love,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
yet others like damon believ'd,anapaestic,10,30,5,wsswssws
the nymph might have favour'd her swain,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswwswsw
and others like him were deceiv'd,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
like him tho' they cannot complain,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
of phyllis was always my song,anapaestic,10,29,6,wsswswsw
for she was my pride and my care,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
and the folks as we wander'd along,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
would call us the conjugal pair,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
they mark'd how i walk'd at her side,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
how her hand to my bosom i prest,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
each tender endearment i try'd,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
and i thought none was ever so blest,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
but now the delusion is o'er,anapaestic,10,28,6,swswswsw
these daydreams of pleasure are fled,anapaestic,10,36,6,wsswswsw
now her damon is pleasing no more,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
and the hopes of her shepherd are dead,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
may he that my fair shall obtain,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
may he as thy damon be true,anapaestic,10,27,7,wswwswsw
or haply thou'lt think of that swain,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
who bids thee dear maiden adieu,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswssws
from lincoln to london rode forth our young squire,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
to bring down a wife whom the swains might admire,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
but in spite of whatever the mortal could say,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswsswswsw
the goddess objected the length of the way,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswswswsws
to give up the op'ra the park and the ball,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
for to view the stag's horns in an old country hall,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsws
to have neither china nor india to see,anapaestic,10,38,8,wwswsswswsws
nor laceman to plague in a morning not she,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
to relinquish the playhouse quin garrick and clive,anapaestic,10,50,8,wswswsswswsw
who by dint of mere humour had kept her alive,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsws
to forego the full box for his lonesome abode,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswswsw
o heav'ns she should faint she should die on the road,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswsw
to forget the gay fashions and gestures of france,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswswsw
and to leave dear auguste in the midst of the dance,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswsw
and harlequin too 'twas in vain to require it,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswwssw
and she wonder'd how folks had the face to desire it,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswwssw
she might yield to resign the sweet singers of ruckholt,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswswswsw
where the citizenmatron regales with her cuckold,anapaestic,10,48,7,wwswswswswwsw
but ranelagh soon would her footsteps recall,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswsws
and the music the lamps and the glare of vauxhall,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
to be sure she could breathe no where else than in town,anapaestic,10,55,12,wwswswswswsw
thus she talk'd like a wit and he look'd like a clown,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
but while honest harry despair'd to succeed,anapaestic,10,43,7,wwswswswsws
a coach with a coronet trail'd her to tweed,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswwswswsws
behold my amanda yon prodigal rose,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswswswsw
flinging forth all its sweets to each zephyr that blows,anapaestic,10,55,10,swswwswwswsw
while each breeze steals some odour or soft tint away,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswswsws
and next sun may destroy what has pleas'd us today,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsws
of beauty so lavish the too selfish eye,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswwswsws
leaves the flow'ret tho' blooming to droop and to die,anapaestic,10,53,10,swsswswswsws
not so that sweet bud where fond nature bestows,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswssws
each promise of fragrance that flaunts in the rose,anapaestic,10,50,9,wsswswswsws
with a blush seems to think she can veil every charm,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswswsw
and artlessly deems not those blushes can harm,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsw
while with delicate prudence it steals on the sight,anapaestic,10,51,9,wwsswswswsws
and comes forth as if frighten'd of giving delight,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswsswssws
when first in eden's roseate bow'rs,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
adam mark'd the lonely hours,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
though in life no pain he knew,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
yet from life few joys he drew,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
still the social passions slept,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
hope alone her vigil kept,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
thus in eden's hallow'd shade,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
sweetly sang the blueey'd maid,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
tenant of this happy plain,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
stranger blest to ev'ry pain,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
still imperfect is thy state,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
what is life without a mate,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
rising with the second morn,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
lovely woman shall be born,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
blest with her thy breast shall know,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
charms divine from love that flow,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
pausing here the blueey'd maid,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
ceas'd to sing in eden's shade,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
charm'd by strains so sweet so blest,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
the common father sunk to rest,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
when appear'd the second dawn,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
pleas'd he trod the verdant lawn,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
seated 'neath a woodbine's shade,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
soon he saw the perfect maid,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsw
each in mutual wonder gaz'd,trochaic,8,27,5,wswswsws
love within each bosom blaz'd,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
rosy blushes tinge the fair,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
smiling cherubs bless the pair,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
each transported with their lot,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
join to bless the nuptial knot,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
to a more sequester'd shade,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
adam led the blushing maid,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
lock'd within each other's arms,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
gazing on each other's charms,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
each exchang'd a balmy kiss,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
giving thus a birth to bliss,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
shall this day unheeded fly,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
and like vulgar days pass by,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
dull as tho' i be,trochaic,8,17,5,wswsw
shall it pass unsung by me,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
no when i this day forget,trochaic,8,25,6,wswwsws
may i share that poet's fate,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
singing what is daily said,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
rhyming what is never read,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
health and joy long life and peace,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
pray we next for poets may,trochaic,8,26,6,wswwsws
sure as well as prosefolks pray,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
and as this day rolls around,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
may you still be perfect found,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsw
still in virtue's noble race,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
pressing for the foremost place,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
scorning all that's low or lewd,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
daring to be great and good,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
till your race of life is done,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
and the glorious meed your own,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswswsw
such as angels now receive,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
such as heav'n alone can give,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
come my muse prepare the lay,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
once more hail this happy day,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
bid it shine o'er all the past,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
brightest since it is the last,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
for her full meridian ray,trochaic,8,25,5,wwswswsw
soon must sicken and decay,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
see she hastens down the skies,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
in another sphere to rise,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
in a world unknown untry'd,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
sets a maid to rise a bride,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsw
having shone his summer's day,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
gilding all the groves and plains,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
drops at length the golden reins,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
and night's curtain round him spread,trochaic,8,36,6,swswsws
hides his beams in thetis 'bed,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
when the british warrior queen,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswswsw
bleeding from the roman rods,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
sought with an indignant mien,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
counsel of her country's gods,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws

what good's in a dame that will pore on a book,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
no give me the wife that shall save me a cook,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswswsw
thus far i had written then turn'd to my son,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
to give him advice ere my letter was done,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
my son should you marry look out for a wife,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
that's fitted to lighten the labours of life,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswsswswsw
be sure wed a woman you thoroughly know,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswsswswsw
and shun above all things a housewifely shrew,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
that would fly to your study with fire in her looks,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswsswsswsw
and ask what you got by your poring on books,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
think dressing of dinner the height of all science,anapaestic,10,50,9,wsswswswswsw
and to peace and good humour bid open defiance,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswwsswsw
avoid the fine lady whose beauty's her care,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
who sets a high price on her shape and her air,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
who in dress and in visits employs the whole day,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswsswswsw
and longs for the ev'ning to sit down to play,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswwswswsws
chuse a woman of wisdom as well as good breeding,anapaestic,10,48,10,swsswswswswsw
with a turn at least no aversion to reading,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsww
in the care of her person exact and refin'd,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswwswswsws
yet still let her principal care be her mind,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
who can when her family cares give her leisure,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswwswswswsw
without the dear cards pass an ev'ning with pleasure,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswswsww
in forming her children to virtue and knowledge,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsww
nor trust for that care to a school or a college,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswwsw
by learning made humble not thence taking airs,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswsswswsws
to despise or neglect her domestick affairs,anapaestic,10,43,7,swswswswssws
nor think her less fitted for doing her duty,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswsswswssw
by knowing its reasons its use and its beauty,anapaestic,10,45,9,wsswswswswsw
when you gain her affection take care to preserve it,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswswsw
lest others persuade her you do not deserve it,anapaestic,10,46,9,wsswswswswsw
still study to heighten the joys of her life,anapaestic,10,44,9,wsswswswsws
nor treat her the worse for her being your wife,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
if in judgment she errs set her right without pride,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswswsw
'tis the province of insolent fools to deride,anapaestic,10,45,8,swsswswswsws
a husband's first praise is a friend and protector,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswssw
then change not these titles for tyrant and hector,anapaestic,10,50,9,swswsswsswsw
let your person be neat unaffectedly clean,anapaestic,10,42,7,swswswswswsw
tho' alone with your wife the whole day you remain,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswwswswsws
chuse books for her study to fashion her mind,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswsswswsw
to emulate those who excell'd of her kind,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
be religion the principal care of your life,anapaestic,10,43,8,swsswswswsws
as you hope to be blest in your children and wife,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswwswsw
so you in your marriage shall gain its true end,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
and find in your wife a companion and friend,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
o'er moorlands and mountains rude barren and bare,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
as wilder'd and weary'd i roam,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
a gentle young shepherdess sees my despair,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswwswsws
and leads me o'er lawns to her home,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
yellow sheafs from rich ceres her cottage had crown'd,anapaestic,10,53,9,sswswsswswsw
green rushes were strew'd on her floor,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round,anapaestic,10,49,7,wswswswswsw
and deck'd the sod seats at her door,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
we sate ourselves down to a cooling repast,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
fresh fruits and she cull'd me the best,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswsws
while thrown from my guard by some glances she cast,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw
love slily stole into my breast,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
i told my soft wishes she sweetly reply'd,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswswsw
ye virgins her voice was divine,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
i've rich ones rejected and great ones deny'd,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswswswsws
but take me fond shepherd i'm thine,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
her air was so modest her aspect so meek,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswsswswsw
so simple yet sweet were her charms,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
i kiss'd the ripe roses that glow'd on her cheek,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswsswswsw
and lock'd the lov'd maid in my arms,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
now jocund together we tend a few sheep,anapaestic,10,39,8,wsswswswsws
and if by yon prattler the stream,anapaestic,10,33,7,wwswswsw
reclin'd on her bosom i sink into sleep,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswwswswsws
her image still softens my dream,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
together we range o'er the slow rising hills,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
delighted with pastoral views,anapaestic,10,29,4,wsswswsw
or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distils,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
and point out new themes for my muse,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
to pomp or proud titles she ne'er did aspire,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswsws
the damsel's of humble descent,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
the cottager peace is well known for her sire,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswwsw
and shepherds have nam'd her content,anapaestic,10,36,6,wsswswsw
come shepherds we'll follow the hearse,anapaestic,10,38,6,wsswswsw
we'll see our lov'd corydon laid,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswsw
tho' sorrow may blemish the verse,anapaestic,10,33,6,wsswswsw
yet let a sad tribute be paid,anapaestic,10,29,7,swswswsw
they call'd him the pride of the plain,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
in sooth he was gentle and kind,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
he mark'd on his elegant strain,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
the graces that glow'd in his mind,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
on purpose he planted yon trees,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
that birds in the covert might dwell,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswwswsw
he cultur'd his thyme for the bees,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
but never wou'd rifle their cell,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
ye lambkins that play'd at his feet,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
go bleat and your master bemoan,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwssws
his music was artless and sweet,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
his manners as mild as your own,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
no verdure shall cover the vale,anapaestic,10,31,6,wsswswsw
no bloom on the blossoms appear,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwssws
the sweets of the forest shall fail,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswwswsw
and winter discolour the year,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
no birds in our hedges shall sing,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
our hedges so vocal before,anapaestic,10,26,5,wsswssws
since he that should welcome the spring,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
can greet the gay season no more,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsw
his phillis was fond of his praise,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
and poets came round in a throng,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
they listen'd they envy'd his lays,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswswsw
but which of them equal'd his song,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
ye shepherds henceforward be mute,anapaestic,10,33,5,wswswswsw
for lost is the pastoral strain,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
so give me my corydon's flute,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswwswsw
and thus let me break it in twain,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
cupid ere depriv'd of sight,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
young and apt for all delight,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
met with folly on the way,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
as idle and as fond of play,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsws
in gay sports the time they pass,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
now run now wrestle on the grass,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
their painted wings then nimbly ply,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws

'till a contest do's arise,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws

gentle love refers the case,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
to the next that comes in place,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
trusting to his flatt'ring wiles,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
and softens the dispute with smiles,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
but folly who no temper knows,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
words pursues with hotter blows,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
'till the eyes of love were lost,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw

in her arms the boy she bears,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
bathing him in falling tears,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
and whilst his want of eyes is shown,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswsws

folly to the board must come,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws

which cytherea loudly prays,trochaic,8,27,4,wswswsws
may be as heavy as the case,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsws
which when all was justly weigh'd,trochaic,8,33,6,wswwsws
cupid's wings now useless made,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
that a staff his feet must guide,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
which wou'd still be apt to slide,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
this decree at last was read,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws

all wrong must be right if they choose to persist,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
i'd have you with caution in wedlock engage,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswwswswsws

whilst her who before was the fairest of flowers,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswwsswsw
the cloud on his brow ever drenches with showers,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
and the man whose rough manners were courteous before,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswsswswsws
gives you every reason to look for no more,anapaestic,10,42,9,swsswswswsws
for such churls i've seen through the whole of their lives,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswswsw
give nought but an oath or a frown to their wives,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
let her speech or her manners be e'er so bewitching,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswswsw
why women should only give mouth in the kitchen,anapaestic,10,47,9,wsswswswswsw

that you'd think him a statue just cut out of stone,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswsswswsw
and his fair one i'll wager not all the year round,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswsswswsw
hears aught of his voice save a humandha sound,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
now some to advise you all evils to shun,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswswsw
bid you ever be happy by holding your tongue,anapaestic,10,44,9,swsswsswswsw
but jack boaster has taught me that this will not do,anapaestic,10,52,11,swsswswswwsw
for when he is railing his dear shall rail too,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswwswswsws

'tis fit for such sin she should daily atone,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswssws
then there's trim little dicky who calls himself bless'd,anapaestic,10,56,9,wswswsswswsw

should you travel life's road with a mate such as these,anapaestic,10,55,11,wwswswswswsw
'tis a chance the whole journey you'd do aught to please,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswswswsws
yet you fondly fancy that yours is a swain,anapaestic,10,42,9,wwswswswsws
whom softness and sweetness will still keep the same,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswswsw
that when years have roll'd on though your locks be turn'd grey,anapaestic,10,63,12,wswswswwswsw

yet as darby and joan you may still be wish'd joy,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
then hold your good humour for that is the charm,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
which can make beauty linger and keep the heart warm,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsws
and when youth with light wings shall for ever have flown,anapaestic,10,57,11,wswswswwswsw
make your darby delighted to sit by his joan,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswsswswsw
had i but the torrent's might,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
with headlong rage and wild affright,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswsws
upon dera's squadrons hurled,trochaic,8,28,4,wswwsws
to rush and sweep them from the world,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswsws
too too secure in youthful pride,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
by them my friend my hol died,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
great cian's son of madoc old,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
he asked no heaps of hoarded gold,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
alone in nature's wealth arrayed,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
he asked and had the lovely maid,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
to cattraeth's vale in glittering row,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsw
twice two hundred warriors go,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
every warrior's manly neck,trochaic,8,26,4,sswsswsws
chains of regal honour deck,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
wreathed in many a golden link,trochaic,8,30,6,swsswsws
from the golden cup they drink,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
nectar that the bees produce,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
or the grape's ecstatic juice,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
flushed with mirth and hope they burn,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsw
but none from cattraeth's vale return,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsws
save aeron brave and conan strong,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
bursting through the bloody throng,trochaic,8,34,5,swswsws
and i the meanest of them all,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsws
that live to weep and sing their fall,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswsws
cease chlorinda cease to chide me,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
when my passion i relate,trochaic,8,24,5,wwswsws
why shou'd kindness be denied me,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
why shou'd love be pay'd with hate,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
if the fruit of all my wishes,trochaic,8,29,7,wwswswsw
must be to be treated so,trochaic,8,24,6,wswwsws
what cou'd you do more than this is,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
to your most outrageous foe,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
simple strephon cease complaining,trochaic,8,33,4,swswswsw
talk no more of foolish love,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwsws
think not e'er my heart to reign in,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
think not all you say can move,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
did i take delight to fetter,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswswsw
thrice ten thousand slaves a day,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
thrice ten thousand times your betters,trochaic,8,38,6,swswswsw
gladly would my rule obey,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
strive not fairest to unbind me,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
let me keep my pleasing chain,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
charms that first to love inclin'd me,trochaic,8,37,7,swswswsw
will for ever love maintain,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
wou'd you send my heart a roving,trochaic,8,32,7,swswswsw
first to love i must forbear,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsw
wou'd you have me cease from loving,trochaic,8,35,7,wswwswsw
you must cease from being fair,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
strephon leave to talk thus idly,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
let me hear of love no more,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsw
you mistake chlorinda widely,trochaic,8,28,4,swswswsw
thus to teize her o'er and o'er,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
seek not her who still forbids you,trochaic,8,34,7,wswwswsw
to some other tell your moan,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
chuse where'er your fancy leads you,trochaic,8,35,6,wsswswsw
let chlorinda but alone,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
if chlorinda still denies me,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
that which none but she can give,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
let the whole wide world despise me,trochaic,8,35,7,swswswsw
'tis for her alone i live,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
grant me yet this one poor favour,trochaic,8,33,7,wswwswsw
with this one request comply,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
let us each go on for ever,trochaic,8,26,7,wswswwsw
i to ask and you deny,trochaic,8,21,6,wwswsws
since my strephon you so kind are,trochaic,8,33,7,wwswswsw
all pretensions to resign,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
trust chlorinda you may find her,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
less severe than you divine,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
strephon struck with joy beholds her,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsw
wou'd have spoke but knew not how,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
but he look'd such things as told her,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswsws
more than all his speech cou'd do,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
of all my experience how vast the amount,anapaestic,10,40,8,wwswsswswsws
since fifteen long winters i fairly can count,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
was ever a damsel so sadly betray'd,anapaestic,10,35,7,wsswswswsws
to live to these years and yet still be a maid,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
ye heroes triumphant by land and by sea,anapaestic,10,39,8,wsswswswsws
sworn vott'ries to love but undmindful of me,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
you can strom a strong fort or can form a blockade,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwswss
yet ye stand by like dastards and see me a maid,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswsswswsw
ye lawyers so just who with slippery tongue,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
can do what you please or with right or with wrong,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
can it be or by law or by equity said,anapaestic,10,37,10,wswswswwswsw
that a buxom young girl ought to die an old maid,anapaestic,10,48,11,wwswswswswsw
ye learned physicians whose excellent skill,anapaestic,10,43,6,wswswswsws
can save or demolish can cure or can kill,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswsswswsw
to a poor forlorn damsel contribute your aid,anapaestic,10,44,8,wwswswswswsw
who is sick very sick of remaining a maid,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswsswswswsw
ye fops i invoke not to list to my song,anapaestic,10,39,10,wswswswswsw
who answer no end and to no sex belong,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswswsw
ye echoes of echoes and shadows of shade,anapaestic,10,40,8,wsswsswswsw
for if i had you i might still be a maid,anapaestic,10,40,11,wswswswswsw
a jolly brave toper who cou'd not forbear,anapaestic,10,41,8,wsswswswsws
tho' his life was in danger old port and stale beer,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsws
gave the doctors the hearing but still wou'd drink on,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswsswswsw
till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswswswswsw
the more he took physic the worse still he grew,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswsws
and tapping was now the last thing he cou'd do,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
affairs at this crisis and doctors come down,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
he began to consider so sent for his son,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswsswswsw
tom see by what courses i've shorten'd my life,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
i'm leaving the world ere i'm forty and five,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
more than probable 'tis that in twentyfour hours,anapaestic,10,48,8,wwswswswswsw
this manor this house and estate will be yours,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
my early excesses may teach you this truth,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
that 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth,anapaestic,10,56,11,swswswswswsw
says tom who's a lad of a generous spirit,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswsswsw
and not like young rakes who 're in haste to inherit,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswswsw
sir don't be dishearten'd altho' it be true,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswswsws
th' operation is painful and hazardous too,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswsswswswwsw
'tis no more than what many a man has gone thro',anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswsswswsw
and then as for years you may yet be call'd young,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
your life after this may be happy and long,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
don't flatter me tom was the father's reply,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswssws
with a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye,anapaestic,10,46,12,wswswswwswsw
too well by experience my vessels thou know'st,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswsswswsw
no sooner are tap'd but they give up the ghost,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
lov'd companions let us sing,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
wake the dear according string,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
come with gladness fill the dome,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
pour the happy song of home,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
now sweet home our steps are free,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
now sweet home we fly to thee,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
let the vaulted roofs resound,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
sacred home with blessings crown'd,trochaic,8,34,5,swswsws
learning thorny are thy ways,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
thought is weary of the maze,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
let us seek awhile the goal,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
where affection rests her soul,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
now o toiling muse repose,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
muse the classic volume close,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
bid the cares of study cease,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
give the vacant hours to peace,trochaic,8,30,6,swswswsw
joyful with the smiling year,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
we will smile for home is near,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
strangers will our song repeat,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
strangers feel that home is sweet,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
bring o bring th' impatient steed,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
let us to the threshold speed,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
where we shed the tear of bliss,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
where we meet a mother's kiss,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
home of childhood swell the strain,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
while we hail thy gates again,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
why aurora thus delay,trochaic,8,21,4,swswsws
slothful goddess give the day,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
many are the mournful stories,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
many are the piercing sorrows,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
love that jewel of our nature,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsw
but 'tis merit makes the purchase,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
'tis not wealth nor sordid riches,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
no 'tis surely sweet contentment,trochaic,8,32,5,swswswsw
think not parents that your children,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsw
or your influence bind their natures,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsws
fifty years have render'd callous,trochaic,8,33,5,swswswsw
but let memory be recorder,trochaic,8,26,5,swswswsws
if at twenty hearts were harden'd,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswswsw
what would be their rigid natures,trochaic,8,33,6,wswwswsw
once within this happy island,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
birth and wealth and growing greatness,trochaic,8,38,6,swswswsw
pride had mix'd with every honour,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsws
nor did there e'er one soft emotion,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsw
yet the wise and gracious donor,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswswsw
and to lead his soul to mercy,trochaic,8,29,7,wwswswsw
youth conjoin'd with all the graces,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
and in every beauteous feature,trochaic,8,30,5,wwsswswsw
flora as she cross'd her garden,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
and when passing sweet alicia,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswswsw
form'd by virtue and by nature,trochaic,8,30,6,swswswsw
many a youth with noble fervour,trochaic,8,31,6,sswswswsw
merit only caught the maiden,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
edwin durst not hope for favour,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
birth nor riches gild his title,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
yet she thinks that fair escutcheon,trochaic,8,35,6,wwswswsw
but alas the world's opinion,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
nor alicia will thy father,trochaic,8,26,5,swswswsw
long was seen the lovely maiden,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
smiles forsook their former mansion,trochaic,8,35,5,swswswsw
this the angry father told her,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswswsw
to her child blanch'd with emotion,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswswsw
ah my love have you deceiv'd me,trochaic,8,31,7,wwswswsw
sure thou knowest i'd die to save thee,trochaic,8,38,8,swswswsws
yes too well i know your goodness,trochaic,8,33,7,swswswsw
and when forc'd to pierce that bosom,trochaic,8,36,7,wwswswsw
your inquiring looks have ask'd me,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsws
and your nice discernment told you,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswswsw
often have you seen my sorrow,trochaic,8,29,6,swswswsw
edwin but i need not tell you,trochaic,8,29,7,swswswsw
the gallant ship her wings unfurls,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
edwin from his lov'd retreats,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
'tis not change of place nor climate,trochaic,8,36,7,swswswsw
neither is the power of absence,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsws
edwin found this truth and drooping,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
sultry suns seem'd in conjunction,trochaic,8,33,5,swswswsw
sad despair and cruel absence,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
and upon his funeral bier,trochaic,8,25,5,swswswsw
equal grief by slower movements,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
deep disease by secret workings,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
absence all her comforts wasted,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
though each day her glowing fancy,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswswsw
o'er her father's rigid nature,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswswsw
live alicia live my daughter,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
my pride and hate i've now discarded,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsw
soon soon may propitious breezes,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswswsw
joy illum'd its former mansion,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
hope shone forth in rays of gladness,trochaic,8,36,7,swswswsw
but ah how short our gleams of pleasure,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsw
joys like arrows swiftly flying,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
alicia heard her edwin's story,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswswsw
every look declar'd her dying,trochaic,8,29,5,sswswswsw
soon her wishes were accomplish'd,trochaic,8,33,5,swswswsw
and her parents mourn'd heartbroken,trochaic,8,35,5,wwswswsw
yearly shall the village maidens,trochaic,8,32,5,swswswsw
and as they list her simple story,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswswsw
peace where art thou to be found,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
where in all the spacious round,trochaic,8,31,6,wswwsws
may thy footsteps be pursu'd,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
where may thy calm seats be view'd,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
on some mountain dost thou lie,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
screnely near the ambient sky,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
smiling at the clouds below,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
where rough storms and tempests grow,trochaic,8,36,6,swswsws
or in some retired plain,trochaic,8,24,5,wwswsw
undisturb'd dost thou remain,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
where no angry whirlwinds pass,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
where no floods oppress the grass,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
high above or deep below,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
fain i thy retreat wou'd know,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
fain i thee alone wou'd find,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
balm to my o'erweary'd mind,trochaic,8,27,5,wswswsws
since what here the world enjoys,trochaic,8,32,6,wswwsws
or our passions most employs,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
peace opposes or destroys,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
pleasure's a tumultuous thing,trochaic,8,29,4,swswswsw
busy still and still on wing,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
flying swift from place to place,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
darting from each beauteous face,trochaic,8,32,5,swswswsw
from each strongly mingled bowl,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
through th' inflam'd and restless soul,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswsws
sov'reign pow'r who fondly craves,trochaic,8,33,5,swsswsws
but himself to pomp enslaves,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
stands the envy of mankind,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
peace in vain attempts to find,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
thirst of wealth no quiet knows,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
but near the deathbed siercer grows,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsw
wounding men with secret stings,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
for evils it on others brings,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
war who not discreetly shuns,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
thorough life the gauntlet runs,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
swords and pikes and waves and flames,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsw
each their stroke against him aims,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswsws
love if such a thing there be,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
is all despair or extasie,trochaic,8,25,5,wswswsws
poetry's the feav'rish fit,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
th' o'erslowing of unbounded wit c,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws

'tis apparent from thence that the moderns excel,anapaestic,10,48,8,swsswswwssws
tho' cheerful discreet and with freedom well bred,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
she never repented an idle word said,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswswsw

lovely shines thy wedded fair,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws

soothing as the fountainstream,trochaic,8,30,4,swswsws

bask in heaven's diffusive ray,trochaic,8,30,5,swsswsws
drink the streams that pass away,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
all may share unless'ning joy,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
why then jealous peevish boy,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
water air and light confine,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
ere thou think'st her only thine,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
ever busy'd ne'er employ'd,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
ever loving ne'er enjoy'd,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
ever doom'd to seek and miss,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
and pay unbless'd the price of bliss,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
have my friends in the town in the gay busy town,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswssw
forgot such a man as john dyer,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswswsw
or heedless despise they or pity the clown,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
whose bosom no pageantries fire,anapaestic,10,31,5,wsswsswsw
no matter no matter content in the shades,anapaestic,10,41,8,wsswswswsws
contented why every thing charms me,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswswsws
fall in tunes all adown the green steep ye cascades,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsws
till hence rigid virtue alarms me,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
till outrage arises or misery needs,anapaestic,10,35,6,wsswsswswsw
the swift the intrepid avenger,anapaestic,10,30,5,swswswsws
till sacred religion or liberty bleeds,anapaestic,10,38,6,wsswsswswsw
then mine be the deed and the danger,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
alas what a folly that wealth and domain,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswwswswsws
we heap up in sin and in sorrow,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswswsw
immense is the toil yet the labour how vain,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
is not life to be over tomorrow,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswswsws
then glide on my moments the few that i have,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
smoothshaded and quiet and even,anapaestic,10,31,5,swswswsws
while gently the body descends to the grave,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw

pollio would'st thou condescend,trochaic,8,31,4,sswswsws

far from doctors potions pills,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
drinking health on native hills,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
thou the precious draught may'st share,trochaic,8,38,6,wwswsws
lucy shall the bowl prepare,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
from the brousing goat it flows,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
from each balmy shrub that grows,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
hence the kidling's wanton fire,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
hence the nerves that brace his fire,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
vigorous buxom young and gay,trochaic,8,28,5,sswswsws
thou like them shalt love and play,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw

when phoebus's beams are withdrawn from our sight,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
we admire his fair sister the regent of night,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswsswswsw
tho' languid her beauty tho' feeble her ray,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
yet still she's akin to the god of the day,anapaestic,10,42,10,swswswwswsw

so to susan i bow charming charlotte for she,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw

tho' nature and taste have combin'd to adorn it,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswssw
yet the artist that owns it wou'd think it severe,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
were a law made to keep him there all round the year,anapaestic,10,52,12,wswswswwswsw
how enrag'd wou'd the rector ofb boscoville look,anapaestic,10,48,8,swswswswswsw
if the king should enjoin him to read but one book,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwswsw
and how would his audience their fortune bemoan,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswswsw
if he gave them no sermons but what were his own,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsww
'tis variety only makes appetite last,anapaestic,10,37,6,swsswswswwsw
and by changing our dishes we quicken our taste,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswsswswsw
long was the great figg by the prizefighting swains,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsw
sole monarch acknowledg'd of marybone plains,anapaestic,10,44,6,wsswsswswsw
to the towns far and near did his valour extend,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswssws
and swam down the river from thame to gravesend,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswsw
where liv'd mr sutton pipemaker by trade,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswswsws
who hearing that figg was thought such a stout blade,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsw
resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswsw
and so sent to challenge the champion of thame,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswsswswsws
with alternate advantage two trials had past,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
when they fought out the rubbers on wednesday last,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswsswsws
to see such a contest the house was so full,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
there hardly was room left to thrust in your skull,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
with a prelude of cudgells we first were saluted,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwsswswswswsw
and two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswssw
till weary at last with inferior disasters,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswsswsw
all the company cry'd come the masters the masters,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswswsswsw
whereupon the bold sutton first mounted the stage,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswwsswswsw
made his honours as usual and yearn'd to engage,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswswsws
then figg with a visage so fierce yet sedate,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswsws
came and enter'd the lists with his freshshaven pate,anapaestic,10,52,9,swswswswswsw
their arms were encircled with armigers too,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
with a red ribbon sutton's and figg's with a blue,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswsswswsw
thus adorn'd the two heroes 'twixt shoulder and elbow,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswsswswssw
shook hands and went to 't and the word it was bilboe,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswwsw
sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswwswsws
was never yet seen in our amphitheatres,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswssw
our commons and peers from their several places,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
to half an inch distance all pointed their faces,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsww
while the rays of old phoebus that shot thro' the skylight,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswswswsw
seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsww
and the gods without doubt if one cou'd but have seen 'em,anapaestic,10,57,12,wwswswswswwsw
were peeping there thro' to do justice between 'em,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswsswsw
figg struck the first stroke and with such a vast fury,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswwswsw
that he broke his huge weapon in twain i assure you,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswswsw
and if his brave rival this blow had not warded,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
his head from his shoulders had quite been discarded,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswwswswswsw
figg arm'd him again and they took t' other tilt,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswssw
and then sutton's blade ran away from its hilt,anapaestic,10,46,9,swsswswswsw
the weapons were frighted but as for the men,anapaestic,10,44,9,wsswswswsws
in truth they ne'er minded but at it again,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswswsws
such a force in their blows you'd have thought it a wonder,anapaestic,10,58,12,wwswwswswswsw
every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder,anapaestic,10,53,9,swswswswswswsw
yet so great was their courage so equal their skill,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswsswsw
that they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
while in doubtful attention dame victory stood,anapaestic,10,46,7,wwswswswswsw
and which side to take cou'd not tell for her blood,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsw
but remain'd like the ass 'twixt the bundles of hay,anapaestic,10,51,10,swswswswswsw
without ever stirring an inch either way,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswwswswsws
till jove to the gods signified his intention,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswssw
in a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswswsw
but the upshot on 't was that at that very bout,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswswswswssw
from a wound in figg's side the hot blood spouted out,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswssw
her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
but figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswswwssws
shew'd the gash and appeal'd to the company round,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswwswsw
if his own broken sword had not given him the wound,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswsswswsswsw
that bruises and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsw
with danger so little with honour so much,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
well they both took a dram and return'd to the battle,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswswwsw
and with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
while sutton's right arm was observed to bleed,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswsws
by a touch from his rival so jove had decreed,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswwswswsws
just enough for to shew that his blood was not icor,anapaestic,10,51,11,swswwswwswwsw
but made up like figg's of the common redliquor,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswwswwswsws
again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswwssw
'till the company cry'd hold enough of cold iron,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswswswswsw
to the quarterstaff now lads so first having dram'd it,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswwsw
they took to their woods and i' faith never sham'd it,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswwswswswsw
the first bout they had was so fair and so handsome,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswwsw
that to make a fair bargain was worth a king's ransom,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswswsw
and sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswsswsw
wou'd have made any fibres but figg's to have smarted,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswsswswwsw
then after that bout they went on to another,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswwswswsw
but the matter must end on some fashion or other,anapaestic,10,48,10,wwswswswsswsw
so jove told the gods he hath made a decree,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
that figg shou'd hit sutton a stroke on the knee,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswsswswsw
tho' sutton disabled as soon as he hit him,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswswsw
wou'd still have fought on but jove wou'd not permit him,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswwswswsw
'twas his fate not his fault that constrain'd him to yield,anapaestic,10,58,11,swswswswswsw
and thus the great figg became lord of the field,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
old plumb who tho' blest in his kentish retreat,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
still thrives by his oilshop in leadenhallstreet,anapaestic,10,48,7,wswswswswsw

in quest of electionadventures they sally,anapaestic,10,41,6,wswswswswsww
tho' much they discours'd the long way to beguile,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswsws
of the earthquakes the jews and the change of the stile,anapaestic,10,55,11,wwswswswswsw
of the irish the stocks and the lott'ry committee,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswsswsw
they came silent and tir'd into exeter city,anapaestic,10,43,8,swsswswswswsw
some books prithee landlord to pass a dull hour,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswswsw
no nonsense of parsons or methodists sour,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswswsw
no poetical stuff a damn'd jingle of rhimes,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswswswsw
but some pamphlet that's new and a touch on the times,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
o lord says mine host you may hunt the town round,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
i question if any such thing can be found,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
i never was ask'd for a book by a guest,anapaestic,10,39,10,wswswswswsw
and i'm sure i have all the great folk in the west,anapaestic,10,50,12,wwswswswswsw
none of these to my knowledge e'er call'd for a book,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswsswswsw
but see sir the woman with fish and the cook,anapaestic,10,44,10,swswsswswsw
here's the fattest of carp shall we dress you a brace,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
would you have any soals or a mullet or plaice,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswwswsw
a place quoth the knight we must have to be sure,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
but first let us see that our borough's secure,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
we'll talk of the place when we've settled the poll,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw
they may dress us for supper the mullet and soal,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswsswswsw
but do you my good landlord look over your shelves,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswwsw
for a book we must have we're so tired of ourselves,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswwswsws
in troth sir i ne'er had a book in my life,anapaestic,10,42,11,wswswswswsw
but the prayer book and bible i bought for my wife,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswsswswsw
well the bible must do but who don't you take in,anapaestic,10,48,11,swsswswswwsw
some monthly collection the new magazine,anapaestic,10,40,6,wswsswswsws
the bible was brought and laid out on the table,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswwsw
and open'd at jotham's most apposite fable,anapaestic,10,42,7,wsswswswswsw
sir freeport began with this verse tho' no rhime,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
the trees of the forest went forth on a time,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
to what purpose our candidates scarce could expect,anapaestic,10,50,8,wwswsswswsws
for it was not they found to transplant but elect,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswswsw
to the olive and figtree their deputies came,anapaestic,10,44,8,wwswswswswsw
but by both were refus'd and their answer the same,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwswsw
quoth the olive shall i leave my fatness and oil,anapaestic,10,48,10,swsswwswswsw
for an unthankful office a dignified toil,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswsswsw
shall i leave quoth the figtree my sweetness and fruit,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswsswsw
to be envy'd or slav'd in so vain a pursuit,anapaestic,10,43,10,wwswswswswsw
thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine,anapaestic,10,52,9,swswswswswsw
he answer'd shall i leave my grapes and my wine,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswsws
to be made or the tool or the head of a clan,anapaestic,10,44,12,wswswswwswsw
at last as it always falls out in a scramble,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswswsw
the mob gave the cry for a bramble a bramble,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswssw
a bramble for ever o chance unexpected,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswwswswsw
but bramble prevail'd and was duly elected,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswssw
o ho quoth the knight with a look most profound,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
now i see there's some good in good books to be found,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswswsws
i wish i had read this same bible before,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswssws
of long miles at the least 'twould have sav'd us fourscore,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswswswsw
you plumb with your olives and oil might have staid,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswsws
and myself might have tarried my wines to unlade,anapaestic,10,48,9,wsswwswswsws
what have merchants to do from their business to ramble,anapaestic,10,55,10,wwswswswswssw
your electioneererrant should still be a bramble,anapaestic,10,48,7,swswswswswswsw

did he torture his head or his bosom with fire,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswsswsw
was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswwsw
did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist,anapaestic,10,45,11,wwswswswswsw
no his holiness rose to this sovereign pitch,anapaestic,10,44,8,swsswswwsws

mother breedwell presented her husband each year,anapaestic,10,48,7,swsswswsswsw
with a chopping brave boy and sometimes with apair,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwsswswswsws
'till the primitive blessing of multiplication,anapaestic,10,46,6,wwsswswswswsw
had fill'd the whole house with a young generation,anapaestic,10,50,9,swswswswswsw
but as that increased so sorrow and care,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswswsw
those primitive curses put in for a share,anapaestic,10,41,8,wsswswswsws
and the toilsome employments of mother and wise,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswsswswsw
had hag'd the poor woman half out of her life,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswswwsw
to the doctor she goes with a pitiful face,anapaestic,10,42,9,wwswswswswsw
and begs he wou'd give his advice in her case,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
she tells him her husband was wretchedly poor,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
and prays he'd consider her chargeable store,anapaestic,10,44,7,swswsswswsw
and prevent for the future her having of more,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswwswswwsw
as for that quoth the sage i've a cure never failing,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswswsw

thrust both legs nor pull off the magical fetters,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswsswsw
till you rise in the morn about family matters,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswsswsw
observe but this rule which i give you in charge,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
and your stock may diminish but never enlarge,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswsswssws
many thanks for your kindness dear sir quoth the dame,anapaestic,10,53,10,swswwswswsws
here she drop'd him a curt'sie if it were not for shame,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswsswswwsw

cupid one day ask'd his mother,trochaic,8,30,6,swswswsw

you're too young my boy she said,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
nor has nature made another,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswswsw

fortune left me as she found me,trochaic,8,31,7,swswswsw
yet let damon own his friend,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
sir your servant and all that sir,trochaic,8,33,7,swswswsw
but indeed i am in haste,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws

i have somewhere seen your face,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
am i grown so great a stranger,trochaic,8,30,7,wwswswsw
yet 'tis hardly half a year,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
since you vow'd in e'ery danger,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswswsw
not your life was half so dear,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
sure the court is mighty lulling,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
not the streams of lethe more,trochaic,8,29,6,wswsws
e'en the groom and dirty scullion,trochaic,8,33,6,sswswswsw

you of your memory was rid,trochaic,8,26,6,wswswsws

what friendship is ardelia shew,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswswsw
'tis to love as i love you,trochaic,8,26,7,wswswsw
this account so short tho' kind,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
suits not my enquiring mind,trochaic,8,27,5,swswswsw
therefore farther now repeat,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
what is friendship when compleat,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswsws
'tis to share all joy and grief,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
'tis to lend all due relief,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
from the tongue the heart the hand,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
'tis to mortgage house and land,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
for a friend be sold a slave,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
'tis to die upon a grave,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws
if a friend therein do lie,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
this indeed tho' carry'd high,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws

underneath the rolling sun,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
this has all been said before,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
can ardelia say no more,trochaic,8,23,5,swswswsw
words indeed no more can shew,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws

this is blenheim's crimson field,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswsws

here retiring squadrons yield,trochaic,8,29,4,swswsws
and a bloodless wreath is gain'd,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
ponder in thy godlike mind,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
all the wonders thou hast wrought,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
tyrants from their pride declin'd,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws

rest thee here while life may last,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
th' utmost bliss to man allow'd,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
is to trace his actions past,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
and to own them great and good,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
but 'tis gone a mortal born,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
swift the fading scenes remove,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
let them pass with noble scorn,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
thine are worlds which roll above,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
poets prophets heroes kings,trochaic,8,27,4,swswsws

men who acted wond'rdus things,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
tho' they yield in same to thee,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
foremost in the patriotband,trochaic,8,27,4,swswswsw
shining with distinguish'd day,trochaic,8,30,4,swswsws
see thy friend godolphin stand,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsw
see he beckons thee away,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
yonder seats and fields of light,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
let thy ravish'd thought explore,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
wishing panting for thy flight,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
half an angel man no more,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
quoth john to his teacher good sir if you please,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
i wou'd beg your advice in a difficult case,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswwswsw
'tis a weighty concern that may hold one for life,anapaestic,10,49,10,swsswswwswsw
'tis in short the old story of taking a wife,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswwsw
there's a pair of young damsels i'm proffer'd to marry,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswwsswsw
and whether to choose puts me in a quandary,anapaestic,10,43,9,wsswswswwsws
they're alike in age family fortune and feature,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswsswswssw
only one has more grace and the other goodnature,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswswswsws
as for that says the teacher goodnature and love,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsws
and sweetness of temper are gifts from above,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswsswswsws
and as coming from thence we shou'd give 'em their due,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswsw
grace is a superior blessing 'tis true,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswsswswsw
ay sir i remember an excellent sarment,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswsww
wherein all along you gave grace the preferment,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswsswswswsw
i shall never forget it as how you were telling,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwsswswswswsw
that heaven resided where grace had its dwelling,anapaestic,10,48,8,wsswswswswsw
why john quoth the teacher that's true but alas,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswsws
what heaven can do is quite out of the case,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
for by day and by night with the woman you wed,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswwswsw
'tis you that must board and 'tis you that must bed,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsw
and a goodnatur'd girl may quickly grow gracious,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswsswsw
but a sourheaded saint will be ever vexatious,anapaestic,10,45,8,wwsswswswsswsw
who the purple ev'ning lie,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
on the mountain's lonely van,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws

grongar in whose silent shade,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
for the modest muses made,trochaic,8,25,5,wwswsws
so oft i have the evening still,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
at the fountain of a rill,trochaic,8,25,6,wwswsws
sate upon a flow'ry bed,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
with my hand beneath my head,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
while stray'd my eyes o'er towy's flood,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswsws
over mead and over wood,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
from house to house from hill to hill,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswsws
'till contemplation had her fill,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
about his chequer'd sides i wind,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
and leave his brooks and meads behind,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
and groves and grottoes where i lay,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
and vistoes shooting beams of day,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
wide and wider spreads the vale,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
as circles on a smooth canal,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsws
the mountains round unhappy fate,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
sooner or later all of height,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
withdraw their summits from the skies,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsws
and lessen as the others rise,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
still the prospect wider spreads,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
adds a thousand woods and meads,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
still it widens widens still,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
and sinks the newlyrisen hill,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
now i gain the mountain's brow,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
what a landskip lies below,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
no clouds no vapours intervene,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsws
but the gay the open scene,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
does the face of nature show,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
in all the hues of heaven's bow,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
and swelling to embrace the light,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
spreads around beneath the sight,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
old castles on the cliffs arise,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
proudly tow'ring in the skies,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
rushing from the woods the spires,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws

half his beams apollo sheds,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
on the yellow mountainheads,trochaic,8,27,4,wwswsws
gilds the fleeces of the flocks,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
and glitters on the broken rocks,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
below me trees unnumber'd rise,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsws
beautiful in various dyes,trochaic,8,25,4,swswswsw
the gloomy pine the poplar blue,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
the yellow beech the sable yew,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
the slender fir that taper grows,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
the sturdy oak with broadspread boughs,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswsws
and beyond the purple grove,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
haunt of phillis queen of love,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
gaudy as the op'ning dawn,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
lies a long and level lawn,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
on which a dark hill steep and high,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
holds and charms the wand'ring eye,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
deep are his feet in towy's flood,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
his sides are cloath'd with waving wood,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswsws
and ancient towers crown his brow,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
that cast an aweful look below,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
whose ragged walls the ivy creeps,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
and with her arms from falling keeps,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
so both a safety from the wind,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsws
on mutual dependence find,trochaic,8,25,4,wswswsws
'tis now the raven's bleak abode,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
'tis now th' apartment of the toad,trochaic,8,34,7,swswswsws
and there the fox securely feeds,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
and there the pois'nous adder breeds,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswsws
conceal'd in ruins moss and weeds,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
while ever and anon there falls,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
yet time has seen that lifts the low,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswsws
and level lays the lofty brow,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
has seen this broken pile compleat,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
big with the vanity of state,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsws
but transient is the smile of fate,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
a little rule a little sway,trochaic,8,27,6,wswswsws
a sun beam in a winter's day,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsws
is all the proud and mighty have,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
between the cradle and the grave,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
and see the rivers how they run,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
thro' woods and meads in shade and sun,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswsws
sometimes swift sometimes slow,trochaic,8,30,4,wswsws
wave succeeding wave they go,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
a various journey to the deep,trochaic,8,29,6,wsswswsws
like human life to endless sleep,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
thus is nature's vesture wrought,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
to instruct our wand'ring thought,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws
thus she dresses green and gay,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
to disperse our cares away,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
ever charming ever new,trochaic,8,22,4,swswsws
when will the landskip tire the view,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsw
the fountain's fall the river's flow,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswsws
the woody vallies warm and low,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
the windy summit wild and high,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
roughly rushing on the sky,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
the pleasant seat the ruin'd tow'r,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsw
the naked rock the shady bow'r,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswswsw
the town and village dome and farm,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
each give each a double charm,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
as pearls upon an aethiop's arm,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswswsw
see on the mountain's southern side,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
where the prospect opens wide,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
where the evening gilds the tide,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
how close and small the hedges lie,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
what streaks of meadows cross the eye,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
a step methinks may pass the stream,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
so little distant dangers seem,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsws
so we mistake the future's face,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
ey'd thro' hope's deluding glass,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
as yon summits soft and fair,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
clad in colours of the air,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
which to those who journey near,trochaic,8,31,6,wswwsws
barren brown and rough appear,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
still we tread the same coarse way,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
the present's still a cloudy day,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
o may i with myself agree,trochaic,8,25,6,wswswsws
and never covet what i see,trochaic,8,26,6,wswswsws
content me with an humble shade,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
my passions tam'd my wishes laid,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
for while our wishes wildly roll,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
we banish quiet from the soul,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
'tis thus the busy beat the air,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
and misers gather wealth and care,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
now ev'n now my joys run high,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
as on the mountainturf i lie,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsws
while the wanton zephyr sings,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
and in the vale perfumes his wings,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
while the waters murmur deep,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
while the shepherd charms his sheep,trochaic,8,35,6,wwswsws
while the birds unbounded fly,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
and with musick fill the sky,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
be full ye courts be great who will,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
search for peace with all your skill,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
open wide the lofty door,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
seek her on the marble floor,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwsws
in vain you search she is not there,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
in vain ye search the domes of care,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
grass and flowers quiet treads,trochaic,8,30,5,wswsws
on the meads and mountainheads,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
along with pleasure close ally'd,trochaic,8,32,5,wswsswsw
ever by each other's side,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
and often by the murm'ring rill,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
hears the thrush while all is still,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsw
within the groves of grongar hill,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
swains of high or low degree,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
poets peers whate'er you be,trochaic,8,27,5,sswswsw
ye who pen the lofty lay,trochaic,8,24,6,wwswsws
or who sigh and nothing say,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
ye who talk of flames and darts,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
radiant eyes and marble hearts,trochaic,8,30,5,sswswsws
say for lovers never lie,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
are ye half so blest as i,trochaic,8,25,7,wswswsw
lo at stella's feet i lay,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
and at night when she's undress'd,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
next her bed behold i'm plac'd,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
swains can you these favours see,trochaic,8,32,6,wswwsws
and not envy happy me,trochaic,8,21,5,wwswsws
i sustain the tripping maid,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
easy tho' to all and free,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
yet she foots it but with me,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
or at church or at the play,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsw
if she ogle or she pray,trochaic,8,23,6,wwswsws
when she trips along the meads,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
or on persian carpets treads,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
in the sprightly month of may,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
fatal month some authors say,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
i both morning noon and night,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
order all her steps aright,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
who durst say when i was by,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsw
stella ever trod awry,trochaic,8,21,4,swswsws
her support unto my end,trochaic,8,23,5,wswswsw
if a pilgrim she should go,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
where the streams of jordan flow,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
i'll sustain her in the way,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
where the streams of jordan stray,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
weary tho' and faint she be,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
all her cares shall rest on me,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
venus in her shape and air,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
cruel tho' nor does she know,trochaic,8,28,6,wswsws
half the pain i undergo,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
tall and comely tho' she be,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
owes she not an inch to me,trochaic,8,26,7,wswswsw
me on whom she treads and tramples,trochaic,8,34,7,wwswswsw
o the force of ill examples,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswswsw
die forsaken lovers die,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
favour'd less tho' true as i,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
so's the heelpiece to the heel,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
true and constant and will never,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
from her shoe or slipper fever,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswswsw
till the sole as ah it must,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsw
seeks its resting place in dust,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
as from envy who is free,trochaic,8,24,6,wwswsws
come pour out your last adieus,trochaic,8,30,6,wswwsws
die and heelpiece stella's shoes,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
at the close of the day when the hamlet is still,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswwswsw
and mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswswswsw
when nought but the torrent is heard on the hill,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
and nought but the nightingale's song in the grove,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswwswswsws
'twas then by the cave of a mountain reclin'd,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
an hermit his nightly complaint thus began,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
tho' mournful his voice his heart was resign'd,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswsws
he thought as a sage but he felt as a man,anapaestic,10,41,11,wswswswswsw
ah why thus abandon'd to mourning and woe,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
why thus lonely philomel slows thy sad strain,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswsswswsw
for spring shall return and a lover bestow,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswwssws
and thy bosom no trace of dejection retain,anapaestic,10,42,8,wwswswswswsw
yet if pity inspire thee ah cease not thy lay,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwsswswswsws
mourn sweetest complainer man calls thee to mourn,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
o soothe him whose pleasures like thine pass away,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswwswswsws
full swiftly they pass but they never return,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswssws
now gliding remote on the verge of the sky,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswsws
the moon half extinct her wan crescent displays,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswssws
yet lately i saw where majestic on high,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
she shone and the stars were conceal'd in her rays,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
roil on thou fair orb and with gladness pursue,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
the path that conducts thee to splendor again,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswswwswsw
but man's faded glory no change shall renew,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswswsws
ah fool to exult in a glory so vain,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswwswsw
'tis dark and the landscape is lovely no more,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
i mourn not ye woodlands i mourn not for you,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
for morn shall return all your charms to restore,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswswsws
perfum'd with fresh fragrance and glittering with dew,anapaestic,10,53,8,swswsswsswsw
nor yet for the ravage of winter i mourn,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswsswswsw
kind nature the embryo blossoms shall save,anapaestic,10,42,7,wsswswswsws
but when shall spring visit the mouldering urn,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswsswswsw
oh when shall it dawn on the gloom of the grave,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
see from yonder hill descending,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
hope with all her train attending,trochaic,8,33,6,wswwswsw
quips and cranks and wanton wiles,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
nods and becks and wreathed smiles,trochaic,8,34,6,wswsws
fancies light that tread on air,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
building fairy castles there,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
olus his harp new stringing,trochaic,8,27,5,sswswsw
tuning to the breezes singing,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
zeph'rus sweeping softest chords,trochaic,8,32,4,swswsws
fancy setting airs to words,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
words that seem another sound,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
and lighter than a breath are found,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
here morpheus comes a wandering guest,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsws
by plaintive murmurs lull'd to rest,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
round him painted vapours stream,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswsws
weaving soft the chequer'd dream,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
which on silken wings they spread,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
shaking o'er his drowsy head,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
subtile fumes waft round the brain,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
and fan these joys so light and vain,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswsws
which soft slumber loves to dress,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
in long robes of happiness,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
see where come the dancing hours,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
sprinkling hope's gay path with flowers,trochaic,8,39,6,swswswsw
thyme that loves the brown hill's side,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsw
heath in lasting colours dyed,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
feathery sprays that softly blow,trochaic,8,32,5,sswswsws
and lead the sweet gales as they go,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
unheeded though the scented air,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsws
fragrance steals we know not where,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
sweet hope lightly dost thou tread,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
bending not the weak flower's head,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
watching every changeful scene,trochaic,8,30,4,swsswsws
sliding gilded shows between,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
where new prospects open still,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
rising fair behind the hill,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
'tis true stern reason scorns thy sway,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
nor basks beneath thy sunny ray,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
nor hears thy accents clear and sweet,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
where sprightly airs and softness meet,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswsws
mixing with harmonic chords,trochaic,8,27,4,swswsws
pouring melody on words,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
nor will his fix'd eye deign to glance,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswsws
on the mirthful mazy dance,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
when the hours all hand in hand,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
link with thee a jocund band,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwsws
when thy white robes float on air,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
catching rays that tremble there,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
tinted with the varying beam,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
ending in prismatic stream,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
on thy head a wreath of flowers,trochaic,8,31,7,wwswswsw
nods in time to dancing hours,trochaic,8,29,6,swswswsw
featheryfooted trim and light,trochaic,8,29,4,swswswsw
flitting round from morn till night,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
from morn till night thou gaily leads,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
through dark green woods and painted meads,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswsws
with roseting'd cheeks and clear blue eye,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswsws
looking through another sky,trochaic,8,27,4,swswsws
till we reach th' enamell'd lawn,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
round which a river journeys on,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
where many a bridge is taught to please,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsw
gothic eyes or gay chinese,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
thrown in every point of view,trochaic,8,29,6,swswswsw
arch can add a beauty to,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws
while here and there an ashling weaves,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
verdant knots of summer leaves,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
now we reach thy mansion high,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
spiral turrets climb the sky,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
gilding clouds of varied light,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
changing underneath the sight,trochaic,8,29,4,swswsws
see what crowds surround the gate,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
see what expectations wait,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
and running out surround their queen,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswsws
ask all at once where she has been,trochaic,8,34,8,wswswsws
and if the promis'd hours were found,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsw
with elysian garlands crown'd,trochaic,8,29,4,swsswsws
or if yet she'd leave to tell,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
where true happiness would dwell,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
or yet had seen the promis'd day,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
when expectation grave or gay,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
in happy blissful bands should be,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
united into certainty,trochaic,8,21,3,wswswsws
she sweetly smil'd and wav'd her hand,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
at which a specious flattering band,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsw
quick through the ear their credence reaches,trochaic,8,44,7,wswswswsw
bow'd round and full of soothing speeches,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswswsw
declar'd the hours would soon appear,trochaic,8,36,6,wswsswsws
then whispering softly in the ear,trochaic,8,33,6,wsswswsws
taught smiles along the cheek to glow,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
as if those hours they well did know,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswswsw
ye promises ye flatterers vain,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswswsw
that dress out hope and varnish pain,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
and make the dullest things appear,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
of shining surface smooth and clear,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
handing the cup to hope's sweet lip,trochaic,8,35,7,swswswsw
of which we guests so fondly sip,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
while seeing all the bottom shine,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
ne'er think there's poison in the wine,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
dark lethe's cup each grief subdues,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
that used on former joys to muse,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
for to hope's enchanted dome,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
dreaded ills dare never come,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
not one mask'd sorrow can you see,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
in all her court of revelry,trochaic,8,27,6,wswswsws
what though ye pull the careless sleeve,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswsws
and would tempt us to believe,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
these noonjoys are waning fast,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsw
form'd only for an hour to last,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswswsw
hence miscreants let me while i may,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsw
enjoy the gewgaws of my day,trochaic,8,27,6,wswswsws
descend sweet hope from thy bright throne,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswsws
glittering with each precious stone,trochaic,8,35,5,sswswsws
rubies red and sapphires blue,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
amethysts of purple hue,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
topazes of sunlike blaze,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
and diamonds with their thousand rays,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsws
descend and mount yon hill with me,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
there let me opening prospects see,trochaic,8,34,6,wswsswsws
which step by step shall fairer grow,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
the while as fades this scene below,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
forests of immortal oak,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
rocks by tumbling torrents broke,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
shallow brooks and rivers wide,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
verdant meads with daisies pied,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
distant cities large and proud,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
mountains dim that seem a cloud,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
castles high that live on hills,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
little cots that seek the rills,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
upland grounds where flocks are seen,trochaic,8,36,6,swswsws
mixing white with darkest green,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
what though painted on the air,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
still they look serene and fair,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
though my foot be left to tread,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
barren heaths with brambles spread,trochaic,8,34,5,swswsws
yet if thou check one falling tear,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
or bathe the eye till it grow clear,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
i'll freely pardon all thy wiles,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
and fancy good in all thy smiles,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
still pleas'd to find the ills we dread,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswsws
thy fairy wing can overspread,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
and though thy promises deceive,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsws
bless my kind stars that i believe,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
thy cranks and wiles who would not see,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswsws
for happy they who doubt not thee,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
my pipe sounds a cheerfuller note,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
my crook is new garnish'd with flowers,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
this day to sweet thoughts i devote,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
where blossom the eglantine bowers,anapaestic,10,34,5,wsswswsw
my sheep unattended may stray,anapaestic,10,29,5,swswswsw
where clover impurples the plain,anapaestic,10,32,5,wsswswsw
my dog unregarded may play,anapaestic,10,26,5,swswswsw
till morning rise on him again,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
'tis fit that they too should partake,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
of the joy that enlivens my soul,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
at night i'll repair to the wake,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsw
and merrily quaff the full bowl,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
just now as i walk'd thro' the grove,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
i met my dear delia there,anapaestic,10,25,6,swswsws
and told her a tale of my love,anapaestic,10,30,8,wswswsws
which she seem'd with soft pleasure to hear,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsw
a blush like the blush of the dawn,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
stole over her beautiful cheek,anapaestic,10,30,5,wsswswsw
smiles sweeter than infants newborn,anapaestic,10,35,5,wswsswsw
told more than i wish'd her to speak,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
i stole from her hand a sweet kiss,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
nor tried she to draw it away,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
no description comes up to the bliss,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
that reigns in my bosom to day,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
methinks every zephyr that blows,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswswsw
soft music conveys to my ear,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
methinks every floweret that grows,anapaestic,10,34,5,wswswswsws
more blooming and fresh does appear,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
the birds tune their musical throats,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsw
and sing most delightfully sweet,anapaestic,10,32,5,swswswsw
in soft and more delicate notes,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
sweet echo my sighs does repeat,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
long time did a silly old proverb prevail,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswssws
that meat drink and cloth were all found in good ale,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
'till a lover of truth went on purpose to hull,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswswsw
and to try the experiment drank his skin full,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswsswswsw
he began to see visions his head it turn'd round,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswsswswsw
'till off from his keffal he fell on the ground,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
there in trances profound our philosopher mellow,anapaestic,10,48,7,wwswswswsswsw
lay all night in the snow consulting his pillow,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsww
oracular vapours give prophecy birth,anapaestic,10,36,5,wsswsswswsw
as plutarch reports springing out of the earth,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsw
whether this was the cause or however inspir'd,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswwswsswsw
our sage gave a sentence will be ever admir'd,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswsswsw
'twas this i pronounce that good ale is good meat,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
for i find i have no inclination to eat,anapaestic,10,39,9,wwswswswswsw
that good ale is good cloth you may honestly boast,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwswsw
for i' faith i'm as blithe and as warm as a toast,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
but to call it good drink is a lye i'll be sworn,anapaestic,10,48,12,wwswswswswsw
for i ne'er was so dry since the hour i was born,anapaestic,10,48,12,wswswswwsswsw
the cloth cries a punster who chanc'd to come by,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw

i go where i will and i come when i please,anapaestic,10,42,11,wswswswswsw
i am plac'd below envy and yet above spite,anapaestic,10,42,9,wwswswswswsw
i've judgment enough still to do myself right,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
some higher some lower i own there may be,anapaestic,10,41,9,wsswswswsws
but ambition and want are both strangers to me,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswswswswsw
when money comes in pleas'd i live till 'tis gone,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
i am happy when with it contented with none,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
if i spend it 'mong friends i count it but lent,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
it thus goes genteelly i never repent,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswssws
with mirth to my labour the hours sweetly pass,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswwsswswsws
though at saturday night i am just where i was,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswswsw

that lassie cares nought for my siller or me,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
the laird he has money the laird he has land,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
but my willie has nought but the sword in his hand,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswswswsw
yet i'd live upon chelsea or even wad beg,anapaestic,10,41,9,wwswswswswsw
should my soldier return wi' a poor wooden leg,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswssw
for i maun be happy when willie comes hame,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswsswswsw
to lo'e the dear laddie i'll never think shame,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswsswswsw
i'll speak up to maggie who often would jeer,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswsswswsw
and cry she's no canty 'cause willie's no here,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
i own when i thought i should see him nae mair,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
my een they grew red and my heart it grew sair,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
to sing or to dance was nae pleasure to me,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswsw
though often i danc'd wi' the tear i' my ee,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
but i'll get to singing an' dancing again,anapaestic,10,41,8,wwswswswsws

if there's riches in love we'll hae gear enough yet,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswswsw
for i ken weel that riches can make themselves wings,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswswsw
that heartaches hide under braw diamonds and rings,anapaestic,10,50,8,wswswswswsw
an' though love canna happiness always ensure,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswsswswsw
it will help us wi' patience our lot to endure,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
sae i'll ay be canty when willie comes hame,anapaestic,10,43,9,wsswswswswwsw

forbear my dear stephen with a fruitless desire,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsws
into truths which are better conceal'd to enquire,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswsswswsww
perhaps many years are allow'd us by fate,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
or next winter perhaps is the last of their date,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswwswsw
let the credulous fools whom astrologers cheat,anapaestic,10,46,7,swswswswswsw
exult or despond as they vary deceit,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswssws
who anticipate care their own pleasure destroy,anapaestic,10,46,7,swswswswssws
and invite disappointment who build upon joy,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswssw
all ills unforeseen we the easiest endure,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswswwswsws
what avails to foresee unless foresight could cure,anapaestic,10,50,8,wswswswsswsw
and from ills by their art how can wretches be freed,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswwswsw
when that art must be false or those ills be decreed,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswwswswsws
from reflection and hope little comfort we find,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsw
to possession alone let thy thoughts be confin'd,anapaestic,10,48,8,swsswswswsws
today's all the treasure poor mortals can boast,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
for tomorrow's not gained and yesterday's lost,anapaestic,10,46,7,swsswswswsw
even now whilst i write time steals on our youth,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
and a moment's cut off from my friendship and truth,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswswsw
then seize the swift blessing enjoy the dear now,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsw
and take not expect what hereafter 'll bestow,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswssws
from these numbers as they flow,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
shepherdmaids this moral know,trochaic,8,29,4,swswsws
soon shall beauty's brightest bloom,trochaic,8,35,5,swswsws
moulder in the cheerless tomb,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
charms that light the blaze of love,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsw
soon the force of time shall prove,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
vainly beams the glist'ning eye,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
quench'd in dust each star shall lie,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
yet when death's destructive dart,trochaic,8,33,5,wwswsws
chills to rest the beating heart,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
virtue's flame unquench'd shall burn,trochaic,8,36,5,swswsws
cheer the grave and gild the urn,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
the bishop of chester,anapaestic,10,21,4,wsswsw
though wiser than nestor,anapaestic,10,24,4,wsswsw
and fairer than esther,anapaestic,10,22,4,wsswsw
if you scratch him will fester,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsw
here lies edmund keene lord bishop of chester,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswswsswsw
he eat a fat goose and could not digest her,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
here lies mrs keene the bishop of chester,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsswsw
she had a bad face which did sadly molest her,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswssw
here lives harry vane,anapaestic,10,21,4,swsws
very good claret and fine champagne,anapaestic,10,35,6,sswsswsws
when you rise from your dinner as light as before,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswwswswsws
'tis a sign you have eat just enough and no more,anapaestic,10,48,11,swswswswswsw
in that eye where expression has sweetly been taught,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswsswswsw
to paint a strong picture of reason and thought,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
yet touch'd with such softness as leads us to know,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswwswswsws
it can start into rapture or melt into woe,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswssw
affection beams forth like the rays of the morn,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
and warms the young rosebud that hope had just born,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw
should words e'er be wanting to speak out more clear,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsw
what tenderness hints in a trembling tear,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswswsw
see gentle persuasion just take up her lyre,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
whose finger all rhetoric gives language to wire,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswwswswsw
till the voice that we love ever closing the strain,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswswsw
shall dwell on the ear till we hear it again,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
then tell me no more that you know not to please,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
with looks so engaging and manners like these,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswsswswsw
thus the lily all meekness unconscious of power,anapaestic,10,47,8,swsswswsswsw
presumes not to vie with a loftier flower,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
yet the lover of sweetness must own ere they part,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwsswswswsws
'tis the lily alone he could wear in his heart,anapaestic,10,46,10,swsswswwswsw
in the dream of the moment i call'd for the bowl,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswsswswsw
but i found that a bumper can't reach the pure soul,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswwswswsws
though fancy may sparkle as shines the gay glass,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
or mirth and good humour shake hands as they pass,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
yet right if i ween for the joys that are past,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
we know gentle maid that such hours cannot last,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswssw
ah well do i know for since reason's young dawn,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
i have mark'd the sweet floweret adorning the lawn,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswswsw
the light leaves of summer that fan us today,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswsws
one breath of cold winter shall waft them away,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswswswsws
since thus it must be since our summers must fade,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
let us make much of life and enjoy her green shade,anapaestic,10,50,11,swswswswswsw
in the search of good humour i've rambl'd all day,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswsswsw
and just now honest truth has discover'd her way,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswsswswswsw
when rubbing his telescope perfectly clear,anapaestic,10,42,6,wsswswswsws
call'd out i have found her and bade me come here,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
i'm grown weary of wit who but dresses for show,anapaestic,10,47,10,swsswswwswsw
and strives still to sparkle as much as your beau,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
for if he can shine though at dear friends' expense,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswsws
he will raise contributions on feeling and sense,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswsswsw
then learning is proud nor can trifle with ease,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
though in this little life 'tis oft trifles that please,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswsswswswsw
unbending austerity wrapt up in self,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswswswsw
is so like a miser when hoarding his pelf,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswsswswsw
strong reason's a warrior that fights out his way,anapaestic,10,49,9,wsswswswswsw
and seldom has leisure to rest or to play,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
nay so rough has he grown unless great things are done,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswswsww
he thinks that all useless went down the bright sun,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswsws
o 'tis gentle good humour that makes life so sweet,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsws
and picks up the flowerets that garnish our feet,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswwswswswsw
then from them extracting the balsam of health,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsw
turns the blossoms of nature to true sterling wealth,anapaestic,10,52,9,swsswswswsws
mortal thou who view'st this cell,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
scorn not here awhile to dwell,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
hence is banish'd noisy sport,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
this is contemplation's court,trochaic,8,29,4,wwswsws
hermits here in days of yore,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
o'er their beads were seen to pore,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
screen'd within this friendly shade,trochaic,8,35,5,swswsws

tenants of the green retreat,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
bards have shunn'd the glare of noon,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
here have hail'd the rising moon,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
here with glitt'ring visions blest,trochaic,8,34,5,wwswsws
have they sunk to downy rest,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
here have wak'd this truth to know,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
wild ambition leads to woe,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
whilst around your eyes you turn,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
from this cell one moral learn,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
far from fortune's flatt'ring gale,trochaic,8,34,5,swswsws
cautious spread your little sail,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
see yon once aspiring fane,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
with ruin sad bestrew the plain,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
whilst within the fretted tower,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
night's lone bird selects her bower,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
yet the zealot's ruffian hand,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswswsw
speeding ruin o'er the land,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
spar'd this rude this humble cell,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
where contentment chose to dwell,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
those who from the prelate's hand,trochaic,8,33,6,wswwsws
tore the crosier's jewel'd wand,trochaic,8,31,5,swsswsws
bad the shepherd by the brook,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
keep secure his beechen crook,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws

pleasure unalloy'd with pain,trochaic,8,28,4,sswswsw
joy that suits the rural sphere,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
gentle shepherd lend an ear,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws

verdant vales and fountains bright,trochaic,8,34,5,swswsws
trees that nod on sloping hills,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
caves that echo tinkling rills,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
if thou can'st no charm disclose,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
in the simplest bud that blows,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
go forsake thy plain and fold,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
join the crowd and toil for gold,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
tranquil pleasures never cloy,trochaic,8,29,4,swswsws
banish each tumultuous joy,trochaic,8,26,4,swswswsw
all but love for love inspires,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
fonder wishes fiercer fires,trochaic,8,27,4,swswswsw
love and all its joys be thine,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
yet ere thou the reins resign,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
hear what reason seems to say,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
hear attentive and obey,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
crimson leaves the rose adorn,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
but beneath 'em lurks a thorn,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
fair and flowery is the brake,trochaic,8,29,6,swswswsw
yet it hides the vengeful snake,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
think not she whose empty pride,trochaic,8,31,6,wswwsws
dares the fleecy garb deride,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
think not she who light and vain,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
scorns the sheep can love the swain,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsw
artless deed and simple dress,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
mark the chosen shepherdess,trochaic,8,27,4,swswsws
thoughts by decency controul'd,trochaic,8,30,4,wswswsw
well conceiv'd and freely told,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
sense that shuns each conscious air,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
wit that falls ere well aware,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
generous pity prone to sigh,trochaic,8,27,5,sswswsws
if her kid or lambkin die,trochaic,8,25,6,wwswsws
let not lucre let not pride,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
draw thee from such charms aside,trochaic,8,32,6,wswwsws
have not those their proper sphere,trochaic,8,34,6,wswwsws
gentler passions triumph here,trochaic,8,29,4,swswsws

sweet encomiasts of the sky,trochaic,8,27,5,swswswsw

thus along th' aetherial way,trochaic,8,28,5,wswswswsws
we attend our monarch's car,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
thus we charm the silent air,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
ye southern gales that ever fly,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws

who as ye skim along the sky,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsws
dip your light pinions in the main,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswswsw
then shake them fraught with genial show'rs,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswsws
o'er blooming flora's primrose bow'rs,trochaic,8,37,5,wswswsws
now cease awhile your wanton sport,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
now drive each threat'ning cloud away,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsws
then to the flow'ry vale resort,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
and hither all its sweets convey,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
and ever as ye dance along,trochaic,8,26,6,wswswsws

of cappadocian george britannia's saint,trochaic,8,39,5,wswsswswswsw
such is the plan by gen'rous edward form'd,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
a plan of glory that beyond the reach,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
of his own conquering arms shall propagate,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
the sov'reignty of britain and erect,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws

but wherefore stand i thus haranguing here,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
unskilful as i am in smooth discourse,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
the coward's argument on force alone,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
i rest my title let the glorious prize,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswswswsw
be hung on high amid the listed field,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
and let me there dispute it there my lance,trochaic,8,42,9,wswswswsws
shall plead my cause far better than my tongue,trochaic,8,46,9,wswswswsws
if any dare deny my rightful claim,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswswsws
not for the brave alone have i ordain'd,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
this institution but for all desert,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsws

of all the rest when in the publick cause,trochaic,8,41,9,wswswswsws
with justice and benevolence employ'd,trochaic,8,37,5,wswswswsws
but thou base mercenary canst thou dare,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
the glorious name of valour to usurp,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws
who know'st no publick cause no sense of right,trochaic,8,46,9,wswswswsws
nor pity nor affection nor remorse,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
who under any chief in any quarrel,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswswswsw

call it not love of glory that is built,trochaic,8,39,9,wswswswsws

on gen'rous principles and noble scorn,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsws

but thou hast serv'd with courage be it so,trochaic,8,42,9,wswswswsws
thou hast thy pay and with it thy reward,trochaic,8,40,9,wswswswsws
pretend no farther nor compare thy deeds,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
dishonour'd by the mean desire of gain,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswswsw

those battles thou hast fought those forty years,trochaic,8,48,8,wswswswsws
of blood and horror which thy vaunting tongue,trochaic,8,45,8,wswswswsws
so high hath sounded are indeed thy crimes,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
flagitious crimes for which th' impartial bar,trochaic,8,45,7,wsswswswsws
of reason wou'd condemn thee as the foe,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
of human nature did not custom screen,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
by her unjust esteem thy guilty head,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws
but hope not honour or employment here,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
unsafe and wretched is that monarch's state,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswswsws

the suit refus'd of these pretenders vain,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswswsws
and by rejecting them embolden'd me,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsws
for valour and nobility and wealth,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
though by their proud possessors vaunted high,trochaic,8,45,7,wswswswsws

and all the rules that in fantastic chains,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
inferior minds confine thus milan's dukes,trochaic,8,41,6,wswswswswsw
thus padua's lords above their country's laws,trochaic,8,45,7,wswswsswsws
have rais'd their heads and trampled to the dust,trochaic,8,48,9,wswswswsws
the pride of freedom that essays in vain,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
their high superior genius to controul,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswswsw
these were my masters mighty prince beneath,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswswsws

to know the false corrupted heart of man,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
his ev'ry weakness ev'ry vice and thence,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
to tempt or break his passions to the yoke,trochaic,8,42,9,wswswswsws

and on the helpless multitude impose,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
the adamantine bonds of fraud and force,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
thus was i train'd thus fitted to conduct,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
the fate of proudest empires thus i come,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswswsw
to claim thy garter edward the just meed,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
of worth praeeminent and in return,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsswsws
my services to offer which no doubt,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsws
thy wisdom gladly will accept for who,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
so fit to serve the majesty of kings,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswswsws
as he who slighting ev'ry meaner tye,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws

devotes his toil experience fortune fame,trochaic,8,40,6,wswswsswsws
nor other favour courts nor refuge hopes,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
but in their high protection led by me,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswswsws
thou royal edward shalt attain that height,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
that glorious summit of imperial pow'r,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsswsw
which not thy mighty ancestors have reach'd,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswswsws
where in a freer air a more enlarg'd,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswswsws
horizon bounded only by thy will,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswswsws
thou shalt exalted sit and view beneath,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
in humbler distances and safer bounds,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsws
those subjects who presumptuous now approach,trochaic,8,44,6,wswswswswsw
too near and with rude hands profane thy throne,trochaic,8,47,9,wswswswsws
nor let weak scruples check thy manly soul,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
in the bright task of glory know great prince,trochaic,8,45,9,wswswswsws
a king's divinity is sov'reign pow'r,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswswsw
the only god before whose shrine the wise,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
their incense offer whence inspir'd they draw,trochaic,8,45,7,wswswswswsw
divine ambition and heroic scorn,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswswsws
of vulgar prejudices vulgar fears,trochaic,8,33,5,wswswswsws
virtue's the people's idol and by them,trochaic,8,38,7,sswswswsws
rewarded well with popular applause,trochaic,8,35,5,wswswswsws
that idle breath the gift and prize of fools,trochaic,8,44,9,wswswswsws
'tis thine to govern not to court mankind,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
nor on their smiles precarious to depend,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswsswsws
but nobly force them to depend on thine,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
o sacred sir can virtue give thee this,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswswsws
this bright supremacy trust not her boasts,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
her idle pageanty of barren praise,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
reject her saucy claims importunate,trochaic,8,35,5,wswswswsws
and selfsupported nor admit her train,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsws
proud independency and publick zeal,trochaic,8,35,5,wswswswsws
those factious demagogues the foes of kings,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswswsws
are virtue then and love of publick good,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
the foes of monarchy and are deceit,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsws
injustice and oppression qualities,trochaic,8,34,4,wswswswsws
becoming and expedient in a king,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswswswsw
then know i not to govern but have nurs'd,trochaic,8,41,9,wswswswsws
for twice these fifteen years ev'n in my heart,trochaic,8,46,9,wswswswsws
a pois'nous viper nay unking'd myself,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsws
by yielding to restrain my sov'reign pow'r,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswswsw
with laws and charters of enfranchisement,trochaic,8,41,6,wswswswsws
not due it seems from monarchs to their slaves,trochaic,8,46,9,wswswswsws
but know vile counsellor of infamy,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
that i disdain thy politics those false,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
and shallow politics by which my sire,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswswsw
weak judging edward was betray'd to shame,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswswsws
and foul destruction while to such as thee,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
his ear and heart incautious he resign'd,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
and was indeed their slave not england's king,trochaic,8,45,8,wswswswsws
by maxims different far have i sustain'd,trochaic,8,40,7,wswsswswsws
the strength and splendor of my regal state,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswsws
on the broad basis of true wisdom fix'd,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
with solid firmness by encouraging,trochaic,8,34,5,wswswswsws
the gen'rous love of virtue and of fame,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
that source of valour pledge of victory,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
by granting to my subjects what indeed,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
is their inherent right security,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswswsws
the cheerful father of content and peace,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
of industry and opulence which fills,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
with smiling multitudes the land and pays,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswswsws
in willing subsidies that prince's care,trochaic,8,39,6,wswswswsws
who lays up treasure in his people's hearts,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswsws
by holding with a firm impartial hand,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
the sleddy scale of justice not alone,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
betwixt my subjects in their private rights,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswswsws
but in the gen'ral more important cause,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
betwixt the crown and them the diff'rent claims,trochaic,8,47,8,wswswswsws
of freedom and of just prerogative,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r,trochaic,8,43,6,wswswswswsw
nor suff'ring others to transgress those laws,trochaic,8,45,7,wswswswsws
that in their golden chain together bind,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
for common good the whole united state,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
but more than all by guarding from contempt,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswsws
or impious violation that supreme,trochaic,8,33,5,wswswswwsws
protrectress of all government and law,trochaic,8,38,6,sswswswsws
religion in whose train for ever wait,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
obedience order justice mercy love,trochaic,8,34,5,wswswswsws
a guard of angels plac'd around the throne,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
her sacred counsels have i still rever'd,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswswsw
her high commands enforc'd her pow'r implor'd,trochaic,8,45,7,wswswswssws
o'er all my subject nations to call down,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
from heav'nly wisdom her eternal fire,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswswsw
a fix'd secure felicity beyond,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswswsws
the force of human prudence to attain,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
these are my arts of government those arts,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
by which my british crown i have advanc'd,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
above th' imperial diadem above,trochaic,8,31,5,wswwsswswsws
the pride of afric's or of asia's thrones,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
i wou'd not tell thee this but that thou seem'st,trochaic,8,48,10,wswswswsws
a stranger to my fame as to my realm,trochaic,8,36,9,wswswswsws
and to the real greatness of a king,trochaic,8,35,8,swswswsws
whose sacred dignity by thee traduc'd,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsws
much it behoves a king to vindicate,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsws
not by rejecting only with disdain,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
thy arrogant pretensions but in thee,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
dishonouring and branding with reproach,trochaic,8,39,5,wswswswsws
thy tenets also the pernicious lore,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsws
of tyrants and usurpers which thy tongue,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
blaspheming justice government and law,trochaic,8,38,5,wswswswsws
hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent,trochaic,8,39,9,wswswswsws
hence from my kingdom with thy quickest speed,trochaic,8,45,8,wswswswsws
lest the revenge of an insulted king,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws
with sudden ruin intercept thy flight,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsws
permit me edward to thy royal voice,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsws
to add my suffrage also and with thee,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
protest against this coward policy,trochaic,8,34,5,wswswswsws
that meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud,trochaic,8,43,6,wswswswswsw
and low unprincely artifice i feel,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
a virtue in my heart a gen'rous pride,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
that tells me kings were cloath'd with majesty,trochaic,8,46,8,wswswswsws
encircled with authority rever'd,trochaic,8,32,4,wswswswswsw
and almost deify'd to teach them thence,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
that goodness and the saving attributes,trochaic,8,39,6,wswswswsws
of heav'n become their office justice chief,trochaic,8,43,7,wswswswsws
and truth the virtue of heroic minds,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws
which were it banish'd from all other breasts,trochaic,8,45,8,wswswswsws
should dwell for ever in the hearts of kings,trochaic,8,44,9,wswswswsws
behold in us great king the ancient priests,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswsws
and judges of this land the druids old,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswswsws
who late in borrow'd characters have stood,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
before thy sage tribunal to prefer,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
the claims of valour wealth nobility,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
and those soft specious flatt'rers who beneath,trochaic,8,46,7,wswswswsws
the rosy wreath of pleasure and of love,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
conceal the sickly and disgustful brow,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsws
of riot and debauch and often win,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswswsws
from weak unmanly princes the rich prize,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
to virtue due and wisdom not to these,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
the cankers of a state but least of all,trochaic,8,39,9,wswswswsws
due to that traytor of his king and country,trochaic,8,43,9,wswswswswsw
who lab'ring to build up the regal throne,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
beyond its due proportion and the strength,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
of those foundations which the laws have laid,trochaic,8,45,8,wswswswsws
o'erwhelms the people and at once o'erturns,trochaic,8,43,7,swswswswsw
his royal master places him at best,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsws
on an uneasy tott'ring pinnacle,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswswsws
the mark of execration and reproach,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsws
these claims hast thou rejected like a king,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswsws
discerning in mankind and knowing well,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsws
the value of his favours like a king,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswswsws
deserving the high office of the judge,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
and arbiter of europe like a king,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswswsws
equal to his great fame and worth the care,trochaic,8,42,9,swswswswsw
of those immortal spirits who this day,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
have quitted their celestial residence,trochaic,8,38,5,wswswswsws
to view and to approve thy glorious deeds,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswswsw
but edward be not thou amaz'd to find,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
that those who lately for thy favour su'd,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
were not the personages they assum'd,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
o king thou art beset with counterfeits,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
the very opposites to us who seem,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswswsws
far better than they are for flattery,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
cameleonlike accommodates with care,trochaic,8,35,4,swswswswsws
to the courthue his changeful countenance,trochaic,8,41,6,wswswswsws
and when a prince is brave magnanimous,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
and high in spirit then ambition wears,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
a face of dignity and nothing breathes,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
but lofty enterprizes conquest pow'r,trochaic,8,36,5,wswswswswsw
and schemes of glory to the sov'reign ear,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
pretending love and care for his renown,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
with more than duteous zeal of these beware,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswsws
for as the theban queen in fables old,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
was by the specious guile of fraudful jove,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
in her amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd,trochaic,8,42,7,wwswswswsws
so by these counterfeits are kings seduc'd,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
ev'n in the most belov'd suspectless shapes,trochaic,8,43,7,swswsswsws
to take a traytor to their royal arms,trochaic,8,37,8,wswswswsws
but thou shalt know them edward by their works,trochaic,8,46,9,wswswswsws
and of this truth be most assur'd that he,trochaic,8,41,9,wswswswsws
who in his private commerce with mankind,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
is mean dishonest interested false,trochaic,8,34,5,wswswswsws
can ne'er be true to thee nor can he love,trochaic,8,41,10,wswswswsws
his prince who feels not for his country's good,trochaic,8,47,9,wswswswsws
thus warn'd we leave thee mighty prince be firm,trochaic,8,47,9,wswswswsws
be constant in the paths of fair renown,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
think it thy duty to revere thyself,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswswsws
the sacred laws of chivalry the wise,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws
injunctions by thy order laid on all,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsws
the garter'd knights so shall thy fame remain,trochaic,8,45,8,wswswswsws
the great example of all future kings,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
farewell for lo the genius of thy realm,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswswsws
with all his pomp attended comes to share,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
and grace the glories of this signal day,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
these clouds of fragrance that farbeaming blaze,trochaic,8,47,7,wswsswswsw
of heav'nly brightness his approach declare,trochaic,8,43,6,wswswswsws
from the gay realms of cloudless day i come,trochaic,8,43,9,wswswswsws
where in the glitter of unnumber'd worlds,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswswsws
that like to isles of various magnitudes,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswsswsws
float in the ocean of unbounded space,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswswsws
on my invisible arial throne,trochaic,8,28,5,wswsswswsw
i sit attended with a radiant band,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswswswsw
of spirits immortal whose pure essences,trochaic,8,39,6,wsswswswsws
while clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt,trochaic,8,46,9,wswswswsws
thro' the dull clay of gross mortality,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws
disclos'd their heav'nly vigour and burst forth,trochaic,8,47,7,wswswswsws
in godlike virtues and heroic deeds,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsws
their albion gracing with as fair a growth,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswswsws
of fame as e'er enrich'd imperial rome,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswswsw
thence ripe for heav'n and immortality,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsws
to me the genius of this happy isle,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswswsws

celestial crowns and everliving praise,trochaic,8,38,5,wswswswsws
recorded in the songs of heav'nly bards,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswswsws
that round my throne their hymns of triumph sing,trochaic,8,48,9,wswswswsws
attuning to the sweet harmonious spheres,trochaic,8,40,6,wswswswswsw
their undiscording lyres and voice divine,trochaic,8,41,6,swsswsswsws
nor thus remov'd to heav'n and thus employ'd,trochaic,8,44,8,wswswswsws
in careless raptures wont they to forget,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
their native country and the public weal,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
to which on earth their labours and their lives,trochaic,8,47,9,wswswswsws
they once devoted but pursuing still,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswswsws
the bent and habit of their souls with me,trochaic,8,41,9,wswswswsws
they watch the british empire still intent,trochaic,8,42,7,wswswswsws
to check alternately th' incroaching waves,trochaic,8,42,6,swswswswssw
of regal pow'r and popular liberty,trochaic,8,34,6,wswsswsswsws

to manifest my presence to declare,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsws
not in those whispers which have often spoke,trochaic,8,44,8,wswswswsws
peace to thy conscious heart but audibly,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws
and evident to all th' assent of heav'n,trochaic,8,39,8,wsswswswsws
to the great business which hath gather'd here,trochaic,8,46,8,wswswswsws
this troop of princes from all nations round,trochaic,8,44,8,wswswswsws

that candidate is edward prince of wales,trochaic,8,40,7,wswswswsws

o generous youth in vain thy goodness strives,trochaic,8,45,8,wsswswswsws
to raise thy captive thus above his fortune,trochaic,8,43,8,wswswswswsw
the king that is not free is not a king,trochaic,8,39,10,wswswswsws
nor can thy bounteous favour reconcile,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsws
honour and bondage to thy conqu'ring son,trochaic,8,40,7,swswswswsw
do thou great edward give this noble mark,trochaic,8,41,8,wswswswsws
of prosp'rous virtue ill becomes it me,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswswsws

the testimony of heav'n to thee my son,trochaic,8,38,8,wswswswswsw

and may thy spirit edward be their guide,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswswsws
in every chapter thou henceforth preside,trochaic,8,40,6,wsswswswsws
in every breast infuse thy virtuous flame,trochaic,8,41,7,wsswswswswsw
and teach them to respect their country's fame,trochaic,8,46,8,wswswswsws
when i heard you were landed i flew to the nine,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswwswswsws
intreating their aid to invite you to dine,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
they told me i came on that errand too late,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
for you were engag'd by the rich and the great,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswsws
already said i they were speedy indeed,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswsw
however i'll try and i hope to succeed,anapaestic,10,38,8,wsswswswsws
those creatures of power who your levee attend,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswssws
if your father were out their conge's would end,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswsw
tho' your personal merit is great 'tis allow'd,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsws
'tis the son of the statesman that weighs with the croud,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswswswsws
i expect not a place nor hope for a pension,anapaestic,10,43,10,swswwswswwsw
the love of the muse is my only pretension,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswssw
i hate to abuse and i never can flatter,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswswswsswsw
i write for no party nor either bespatter,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsww
from the lands of parnassus the rents are illpaid,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsws
and england has cruelly cramp'd us in trade,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsws
so look not for china or service of plate,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswsswswsw
or ought that is costly to tempt you to eat,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
yet a way to engage you i think i have hit on,anapaestic,10,45,12,wswswswwswwsw
i mean to remember our friends in greatbritain,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsws
two bottles of wine and two dishes i'll give,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
then fly from the crouds that oppress you and live,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
the first glass shall welcome you sir to our coast,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
and dear lady conway shall be my next toast,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswwsw
with mirth and good humour i'll make up the treat,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
i know you're too wise to love dining in state,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
though low is my cot and the scene all around,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswwswswsws
yet here even here it is thought may be found,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswswswsws
when aurora walks forth and collects her perfume,anapaestic,10,48,8,swswswswswsw
her eye can look down just as fond to illume,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
all nature beholding she smiles as she sees,anapaestic,10,43,8,wsswswswsws
as she looks at the lustre that darts through the trees,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswsswswsw
if such things to observe while beneath the dark oak,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswsswsw
bid them haste while the dryads the songsters invoke,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswsswswsw
for as yet the rude catch from the briar may be borne,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwsswsw
since we yet can remember the harsh wounding thorn,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsws
but soon yellow autumn the green leaves shall stain,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswswsws
though now whetting scythes the gay season proclaim,anapaestic,10,51,8,swsswswswsw
yet nature still changing that season shall bring,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
when the gadding gay woodbine no longer shall cling,anapaestic,10,51,9,wwswswswswsw
with you i must own should the glow of the plain,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
though fond of the scene i no more would complain,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
and without them how oft have i sigh'd as i view'd,anapaestic,10,50,11,swswwswwswsw
thy regrets silly heart were too fondly renew'd,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswsswswswsw
what joy would i say can these beauties bestow,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
though nature shed incense wherever i go,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
for ah i have found in the bosom alone,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswssws
if we make not this cellliving goddess our own,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswsswswsw
for fancy that fairy will darken the glade,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
will heighten or lessen the falling cascade,anapaestic,10,43,7,wsswsswssws
yet still there's a nymph with as magical powers,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswsswsw
and she even she can hand round the dull hours,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswswsw
what though she is rural and best loves the grove,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
yet not to one spot does she fasten her love,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
she rambles about and i meet her at eve,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswswswswsw
at noon in the shade help her chaplets to weave,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
to such favour i've got that my friends she will guide,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswsw
that they shall not be weary when set by my side,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswsswswsw
deck'd with rays of purple light,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
hither cupid wing thy flight,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
through the pure unclouded sky,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
let thy shafts unnumber'd fly,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
bid the warblers of the grove,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
bow before the shrine of love,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
and with thy resistless dart,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
pierce o pierce each youthful heart,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
hark how round thy hallow'd shrine,trochaic,8,34,6,wswwsws
sweetly chaunt the tuneful nine,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
o'er the green enamel'd plains,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
pouring all their magic strains,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
phoebus now with fervid rays,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
lights thy altar's holy blaze,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
and touching soft his magic lyre,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
joins the sweet aonian choir,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsws
on the banks of the severn a desperate maid,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswsswsws
whom some shepherd neglecting his vows had betray'd,anapaestic,10,51,8,wwsswswswsws
stood resolving to banish all sense of the pain,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswsswswsw
and pursue thro' her death a revenge on the swain,anapaestic,10,49,10,swswswswswsw
since the gods and my passion at once he defies,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswwswswsws
since his vanity lives whilst my character dies,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswswsw
no more did she say will i trifle with fate,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
but commit to the waves both my love and my hate,anapaestic,10,48,11,swswswswswsw
and now to comply with that furious desire,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswsswsw
just ready to plunge and alone to expire,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
some reflections on death and its terrors untry'd,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswswswssws
some scorn for the shepherd some flashings of pride,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswsswswsw
at length pull'd her back and she cry'd why this strife,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswswswsw
since the swains are so many and i've but one life,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswwsw
once on a time as old stories reherse,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsws
a fryer would needs show his talent in latin,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswsswsw
but was sorely put to't in the midst of a verse,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswswswswsw
when behold the next morning a wonderful riddle,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswswsw
he found it was strangely fill'd in the middle,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswswswwsw
let censuring criticks then think what they list on't,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswwswswsw
who would not write verses with such an assistant,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
this put me the fryar into an amazement,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswwswswswsw
that came through the keyhole or in at the casement,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswswsw
howe'er it was civil in angel or elf,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswsswswsw
for he ne're could have fill'd it so well of himself,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwsswwswswsws
even so master doctor had puzzled his brains,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswwsw
he had mixt little wit with a great deal of pains,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswwswsw
and tho' some malicious young spirit did do't,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswsswswsw
you may know by the hand it had no cloven foot,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswssw
dear colin prevent my warm blushes,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswswsw
since how can i speak without pain,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
my eyes have oft told you their wishes,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
ah can't you their meaning explain,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
my passion wou'd lose by expression,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswswsw
and you too might cruelly blame,anapaestic,10,31,6,wwswsws
then don't you expect a confession,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
of what is too tender to name,anapaestic,10,29,7,wwswswsw
since yours is the province of speaking,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswwsswsw
why shou'd you expect it of me,anapaestic,10,30,7,swswswsw
our wishes shou'd be in our keeping,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
'till you tell us what they shou'd be,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
then quickly why don't you discover,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswswsw
did your breast feel tortures like mine,anapaestic,10,39,7,wwswswsw
eyes need not tell over and over,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsws
what i in my bosom consine,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswwssws
i sigh and lament me in vain,anapaestic,10,28,7,swswswsw
alas it increases my pain,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswswsws
through the grates of my prison i see,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
my heart how it pants to be free,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
ye roofs where cold damps and dismay,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
how comfortless passes the day,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
the owls from the battlements cry,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
'o mary prepare thee to die',anapaestic,10,28,6,wsswswsw
unchang'd by the rigors of fate,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
though fortune has clouded my state,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
false woman in ages to come,anapaestic,10,27,6,wsswswsw
and when we are cold in the tomb,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
on the brow of a hill a young shepherdess dwelt,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
who no pangs of ambition or love had e'er felt,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswsswswsw
for a few sober maxims still ran in her head,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsws
that'twas better to earn ere she eat her brown bread,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswswswsw
that to rise with the lark was conducive to health,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
and to folks in a cottage contentment was wealth,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswsswswsw
who at church and at market was reckon'd a beau,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswwsw
had many times try'd o'er her heart to prevail,anapaestic,10,46,9,wsswswswsws
and would rest on his pitchfork to tell her his tale,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswwswswsws
with his winning behaviour he melted her heart,anapaestic,10,46,8,swsswsswswsw
but quite artless herself she suspected no art,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswswswswsw
he had sigh'd and protested had kneel'd and implor'd,anapaestic,10,52,9,wwswsswswsws
and could lye with the grandeur and air of a lord,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
then her eyes he commended in language well drest,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswsswsw
and enlarg'd on the torments that troubled his breast,anapaestic,10,53,9,swswwswswwsw
'till his sighs and his tears had so wrought on her mind ',anapaestic,10,58,13,wwswswswswsw
that in downright compassion to love she inclin'd,anapaestic,10,49,8,wwswswwswsws
but as soon as he'd melted the ice of her breast,anapaestic,10,48,11,wwswwswswsws
all the flames of his love in a moment decreast,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswwswsw
and at noon he goes flaunting all over the vale,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswwsw
where he boasts of his conquest to susan and nell,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswsswsw
tho' he sees her but seldom he's always in haste,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswsswsw
and if ever he mentions her makes her his jest,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwsswswswsws
all the day she goes sighing and hanging her head,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswsswswsw
and her thoughts are so pester'd she scarce earns her bread,anapaestic,10,59,11,wswswsswswsw
the whole village cry shame when a milking she goes,anapaestic,10,51,10,swsswswwswsw
that so little affection is shew'd to the cows,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwsswswswsws
but she heeds not their railing e'en let 'em rail on,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswwswswswsw
and a fig for the cows now her sweetheart is gone,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
now beware ye young virgins of britain's gay isle,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswswsw
how ye yield up your hearts to a look and a smile,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
for cupid is artful and virgins are frail,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
and you'll find a false roger in every vale,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswsswswsw
who to court you and tempt you will try all his skill,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
but remember the lass on the brow of the hill,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswswswsw
no more of my harriot of polly no more,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswwswswswsw
nor all the bright beauties that charm'd me before,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswswsws

her mien is more stately her breast is more white,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
her sweet lips are rubies all rubies above,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
which are fit for the language or labour of love,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswwsw
at the park in the mall at the play in the box,anapaestic,10,46,12,wswswswwswsw

the fields and the woods in the vale or the hill,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
the trees and the cotage that peeps out between,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswwswswsws
the clear stream that runs bubbling in many a rill,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswsswswsw
that will show your fair face as you stand on the brink,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswswwswsw

and the woodbine breathes sweetest at close of the day,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswsw
he takes her soft hand and he tips her the wink,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
come my dear let us take a cool walk on the link,anapaestic,10,48,12,wswswswswsws
but o ye fair maidens be sure have a care,anapaestic,10,41,10,wwswswswsws

if you walk in the evening too late on the link,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswwswswsws
ye poets so lofty who love to retire,anapaestic,10,36,8,wsswswswsws

how the verses run easy and glibly along,anapaestic,10,40,8,wwswswswssws
and the rhime at the close how it falls with a clink,anapaestic,10,52,12,wwswswswswsw
so kind are the muses that sport on the link,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
how oft by the lamp of the pale waning moon,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
would kitty steal out from the eye of the town,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
on the beach as she stood when the wild waves would roll,anapaestic,10,56,12,wwswswswswsw
her eye shed a torrent just fresh from the soul,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
and as o'er the ocean the billows would stray,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswsswswsw
her sighs follow after as moaning as they,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswswwsw
i saw as the ship to the harbour drew near,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswsw
hope redden her cheek then it blanch'd with chill fear,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswswsw
she wish'd to inquire of the whispering crew,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswwswsw
if they'd spoke with the roebuck or aught of her knew,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswsswswsw
for long in conjecture her fate had been toss'd,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
nor knew we for certain the roebuck was lost,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
i pitied her feelings and saw what she'd ask,anapaestic,10,44,9,wsswswswsws
for innocence ever looks through a thin mask,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
i stepp'd up to jack oakum his sad head he shook,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswsswswsw
and cast on sweet kitty a sideglancing look,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswsswswsw
the roebuck has founder'd the crew are no more,anapaestic,10,46,9,wsswswswsws
nor again shall jack bowling be welcom'd on shore,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswswsw

o tell me she cried for my soul's in alarm,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
is she lost i said nothing whilst jack gave a sigh,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswsswswsw
then down dropp'd the curtain that hung o'er her eye,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswswswsws
fleeting life for a moment seem'd willing to stay,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswwsswswsw
just flutter'd and then fled for ever away,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswssws
so droops the pale lily surcharg'd with a shower,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswsswwsw
sunk down as with sorrow so dies the sweet flower,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswswsw
no sunbeam returning no spring ever gay,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswsswswsws
can give back the soft breath once wafted away,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw

then rarely approach and respectfully bow,anapaestic,10,41,6,wswswswswsw
but not fulsomely pert nor fopishly low,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
but when the long hours of publick are past,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswsswswsw
and we meet with champagne and a chicken at last,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswwswsw
may ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswssws
be banish'd afar both discretion and fear,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswswsw
forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
he may cease to be formal and i to be proud,anapaestic,10,43,11,wswswswswwsw
till lost in the joy we confess that we live,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
and he may be rude and yet i may forgive,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswwsws
and that my delight may be solidly fix'd,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswsswswsw
in whose tender bosom my soul may confide,anapaestic,10,41,8,wwswswswsws
whose kindness can sooth me whose counsel can guide,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsw
from such a dear lover as here i describe,anapaestic,10,41,9,wwswswswsws
no danger should fright me no millions should bribe,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsw
but till this astonishing creature i know,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswsswswsw
as i long have liv'd chaste i will keep myself so,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswssw
i never will share with the wanton coquet,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
or be caught by a vain affectation of wit,anapaestic,10,41,9,wwswswswswsw
the toasters and songsters may try all their art,anapaestic,10,48,9,wsswswswsws
but never shall enter the pass of my heart,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswsws
i loath the lewd rake the dress'd fopling despise,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswssws
before such pursuers the nice virgin flies,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswsswswsws
and as ovid has sweetly in parables told,anapaestic,10,40,8,wwswswswswsw

'tis the muse that deigns to ask,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
can thy hand forget its task,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
or can the lyre its strains refuse,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
to the patron of the muse,trochaic,8,25,6,wwswsws
hark what notes of artless love,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
the feather'd poets of the grove,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
grateful for the bowers they fill,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
warble wild on sion hill,trochaic,8,24,5,wswswsw
in tuneful tribute duely paid,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws

raptur'd thoughts that want but words,trochaic,8,37,6,swswsws

the gentle sharer of his heart,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws

time that felt affliction's chain,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws

sweet amelia now is prest,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
with double transport to her breast,trochaic,8,35,6,wsswswsw
sweet amelia thoughtless why,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
imitates the general joy,trochaic,8,24,4,swswswsw
innocent of care or guile,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
see the lovely mimic smile,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
and as the heartfelt raptures rise,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws

and to add a sweeter grace,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
give her soft amelia's face,trochaic,8,27,5,swswswsw
mason why this dull delay,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
haste to sion haste away,trochaic,8,24,5,wswswsw
there the muse again shall ask,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
nor thy hand forget its task,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
nor the lyre its strains refuse,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
come chloe and give me sweet kisses,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
for sweeter sure never girl gave,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
but why in the midst of my blisses,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
do you ask me how many i'd have,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswswsw
i'm not to be stinted in pleasure,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
then pr'ythee my charmer be kind,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswswsw
for whilst i love thee above measure,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
to numbers i'll ne'er be confin'd,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws

count the flocks that on tempe are straying,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsws
or the grain that rich sicily yields,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsw
go number the stars in the heaven,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
count how many sands on the shore,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
when so many kisses you've given,anapaestic,10,32,6,wwswsswsw
i still shall be craving for more,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
to a heart full of love let me hold thee,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswsws

what joy can be greater than this is,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
my life on thy lips shall be spent,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws

from the claybuilt cottageridge,trochaic,8,31,4,wwswssws

he smil'd at my folly and gave me to know,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswwswswsws
your wit and not mine by your writing you shew,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
and then says the god still to make you more vain,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
he hath promis'd that i shall enlighten your brain,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswswswsw
when he knows in his heart if he speak but his mind,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswswswwswsw
that no woman alive can now boast i am kind,anapaestic,10,43,10,swsswswswsws
for since daphne to shun me grew into a laurel,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswsswsw
with the sex i have sworn still to keep up the quarrel,anapaestic,10,54,12,wwswswswswwsw
i thought it all joke 'till by writing to you,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw

if her chintz with less expence,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
flows in easy negligence,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
still she lights the conscious flame,trochaic,8,36,6,swswsws
still her charms appear the same,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
if she strikes the vocal strings,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
if she's silent speaks or sings,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
if she sit or if she move,trochaic,8,25,7,wswswsw

beauty which depends on art,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws

then preach not to me as my life steals away,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswwswsws
the sands in thy glass in soft silence depart,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswssws
but the drops there in mine fill the tubes of the heart,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswwswswsw
and thou would'st smile too if my fair one thou'd toast,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswswswsw
her charms will dissolve e'en thy age's chill frost,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswsswswsw

or where is the treasure can buy off a sigh,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
did riches e'er purchase the loan of tomorrow,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswswsw
or find out a medicine to cure the moist eye,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswswsw
let wealth spread her carpet and ask the gay hours,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
to dance in light circles its borders along,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
they'd sooner tend patrick to nature's green bowers,anapaestic,10,51,8,wswswswsswsw

midst the joys of the heart sits one tender affection,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswswswsw
to heal every sorrow when tortur'd with pain,anapaestic,10,44,8,swsswsswswsw
and when feeling sinks down into silent dejection,anapaestic,10,49,8,wwswswswsswsw
sends hope with her cordial to cheer her again,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswwswswsws
thus love has shown norah the feints of high station,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswswswsw
and told her that peace seldom joins the gay throng,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw

love alone can pleasure give,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
pomp and pow'r and tinsel state,trochaic,8,31,6,swsswsws
those false pageants of the great,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
crowns and scepters envied things,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws

when compar'd to love's sweet joys,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
fancy whose delusions vain,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
sport themselves with human brain,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws
rival thou of nature's pow'r,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
can'st from thy exhaustless store,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws
bid a tide of sorrow flow,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
and whelm the soul in deepest woe,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
or in the twinkling of an eye,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswswsw
raise it to mirth and jollity,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
dreams and shadows by thee stand,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
taught to run at thy command,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
and along the wanton air,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
flit like empty gossimer,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
thee black melancholy of yore,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
to the swiftwing'd hermes bore,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
from the mixture of thy line,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
different natures in thee join,trochaic,8,30,5,sswswsws
which thou chusest to express,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
by the variance of thy dress,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswswsw

light and gay with pinions trim,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
dipt in all the dyes that glow,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
in the bend of iris' bow,trochaic,8,24,6,wwswsws
now like thy mother drear and sad,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswswsw
all in mournful vestments clad,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
cypress weeds and sable stole,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
thou rushest on th' affrighted soul,trochaic,8,35,6,wsswswsws
oft i feel thee coming on,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
when the night hath reach'd her noon,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
and darkness partner of her reign,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
round the world hath bound her chain,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
then with measur'd step and slow,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
in the churchyard path i go,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
and while my outward senses sleep,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
lost in contemplation deep,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
sudden i stop and turn my ear,trochaic,8,29,7,swswswsw
and list'ning hear or think i hear,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
first a dead and sullen sound,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
walks along the holy ground,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
then thro' the gloom alternate break,trochaic,8,36,6,swswswsw
groans and the shrill screechowl's shriek,trochaic,8,41,6,swswsws
lo the moon hath hid her head,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
and the graves give up their dead,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
by me pass the ghastly crowds,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
wrapt in visionary shrouds,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
maids who died with love forlorn,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
youths who fell by maidens' scorn,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
helpless sires and matrons old,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
slain for sordid thirst of gold,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
and babes who owe their shorten'd date,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
to cruel stepdames ruthless hate,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
each their sev'ral errands go,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
to haunt the wretch that wrought their woe,trochaic,8,42,8,wswswsws
from their sight the caitiff flies,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswsws
and his heart within him dies,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
while a horror damp and chill,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
thro' his frozen blood doth thrill,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
and his hair for very dread,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
bears itself upon his head,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
when the early breath of day,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
hath made the shadows flee away,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
still possess'd by thee i rove,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
bosom'd in the shelt'ring grove,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
there with heart and lyre new strung,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
meditate the lofty song,trochaic,8,23,4,swswsws
and if thou my voice inspire,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwsws
and with wonted frenzy fire,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswswsw
aided by thee i build the rhyme,trochaic,8,31,7,swswswsw
such as nor the flight of time,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
nor wasting flame nor eating show'r,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsw
nor lightning's blast can e'er devour,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswswsw
or if chance some moral page,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
my attentive thoughts engage,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
on i walk with silent tread,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
under the thickwoven shade,trochaic,8,26,4,wswswsw
while the thrush unheeded by,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
tunes her artless minstrelsy,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
list'ning to their sacred lore,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
i think on ages long past o'er,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsws
when truth and virtue hand in hand,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
walk'd upon the smiling land,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
thence my eyes on britain glance,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
and awaken'd from my trance,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
while my busy thoughts i rear,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
oft i wipe the falling tear,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
when the night again descends,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
and her shadowy cone extends,trochaic,8,28,5,wwsswsws
o'er the fields i walk alone,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
by the silence of the moon,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
hark upon my left i hear,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws
wild musick wand'ring in the air,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
led by the sound i onward creep,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
and thro' the neighb'ring hedge i peep,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
there i spy the fairy band,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
dancing on the level land,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
now with step alternate bound,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsw
join'd in one continu'd round,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
now their plighted hands unbind,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
and such tangled mazes wind,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
as the quick eye can scarce pursue,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
and wou'd have puzzled that fam'd clue,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
which led th' athenian's unskill'd feet,trochaic,8,39,6,swswswswsw
thro' the labyrinth of crete,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
at the near approach of day,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
sudden the musick dies away,trochaic,8,27,5,sswswsws
wasting in the sea of air,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
and the phantoms disappear,trochaic,8,26,4,wwswsws
all as the glowworm waxes dim,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
vanish like a morning dream,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
and of their revels leave no trace,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
save the ring upon the grass,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
when the elphin show is fled,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
home i haste me to my bed,trochaic,8,25,7,wswswsw
there if thou with magick wand,trochaic,8,30,6,wswwsws
on my temples take thy stand,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
i see in mix'd disorder rise,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsws
all that struck my waking eyes,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
so when i stand and round me gaze,trochaic,8,33,8,wswswsws
where the fam'd lodona strays,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
on the woods and thickets brown,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
that its sedgy margin crown,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
and watch the vagrant clouds that fly,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
thro' the vast desart of the sky,trochaic,8,32,7,swswswsw
when adown i cast my look,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
on the smooth unruffled brook,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
while its current clear doth run,trochaic,8,32,6,wswsws
and holds its mirrour to the sun,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
there i see th' inverted scene,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
fall and meet the eye again,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
nymph that flies the crowded street,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
and the proud lord's pompous seat,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
now a naad of the wood,trochaic,8,22,6,wswsws
now a dryad of the flood,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws
ever blythe and young and gay,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
health accept the unpolish'd lay,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws

nor the cooling fragrant breeze,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
nor the lov'd approach of morn,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
nor the walk through waving corn,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
nor the blackbird's serenade,trochaic,8,28,4,wwswsws
echoing from the distant shade,trochaic,8,30,5,swswwsws
nor the gifts of summer's hand,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
flowrets fair or odours bland,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
or each cheerful rural sight,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws

to the wretch that sighs for thee,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw

the pinks by the rivulet's side,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
that border the vernal alcove,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswsswsw
bend downwards to kiss the soft tide,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws

the stockdove recluse with her mate,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
conceals her fond bliss in the grove,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
and murmuring seems to repeat,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws

long with undistinguish'd flame,trochaic,8,31,4,swswsws
i lov'd each fair each witty dame,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
my heart the belleassembly gain'd,trochaic,8,33,5,wswswsws
and all an equal sway maintain'd,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
but when you came you stood confess'd,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
sole sultana of my breast,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
for you eclips'd supremely fair,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswswsw
all the whole seraglio there,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswswsw
in this her mien in that her grace,trochaic,8,34,8,wswswsws
in a third i lov'd a face,trochaic,8,25,7,wswswsw
but you in ev'ry feature shine,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
universally divine,trochaic,8,18,2,swswsws
what can those tumid paps excel,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
do they sink or do they swell,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
while those lovely wanton eyes,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
sparkling meet them as they rise,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
thus is silver cynthia seen,trochaic,8,27,5,swswswsw
glistening o'er the glassy green,trochaic,8,32,5,swswwsws
while attracted swell the waves,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
emerging from their inmost caves,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
when to sweet sounds your steps you suit,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswsws
and weave the minuet to the lute,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswswsw
heav'ns how you glide her neck her chest,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswsws
does she move or does she rest,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
as those roguish eyes advance,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
let me catch their sidelong glance,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
soon or they'll elude my sight,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
quick as light'ning and as bright,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
thus the bashful pleiad cheats,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
the gazer's eye and still retreats,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
then peeps agen then skulks unseen,trochaic,8,34,6,swsswsws

when i ask a kiss or so,trochaic,8,23,7,wswswsw

so comely her shape and so decent her air,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
so skilful that nature's improv'd by her art,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswwswsws
so prudent her head and so bounteous her heart,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
so wise without pride and so modestly neat,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
'tis strange this agreeable creature's a cheat,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswswsw
for tho' she to man for a mortal was giv'n,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswsw
these virtues betray her extraction from heav'n,anapaestic,10,47,7,wswswswswsw
what do scholars and bards and astronomers wise,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswswsw
mean by stuffing our heads with nonsense and lies,anapaestic,10,49,9,swsswswswsw
by telling us venus must always appear,anapaestic,10,38,7,wsswswswsws
in a car or a shell or a twinkling star,anapaestic,10,39,10,wswswswwswsw
drawn by sparrows or swans or dolphins or doves,anapaestic,10,47,9,swsswswswsw
attended in form by the graces and loves,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
that ambrosia and nectar is all she will taste,anapaestic,10,46,9,swsswswswwsw
and her passport to hearts on a belt round her waist,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
without all this bustle i saw the bright dame,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswwswswsws
to supper last night to py's she came,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
in a good warm sedan no fine open car,anapaestic,10,37,9,wswswswswsw
two chairmen her doves and a flambeau her star,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
no nectar she drank no ambrosia she eat,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswsswswsw
nor wanted a cestus her bosom to grace,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsw
for rd that night had lent her her face,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswswsw
once a grove of sweet myrtles soft venus would rear,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswsswsw
'twas a green shade for hope in each change of the year,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswswwswsw
hymen mark'd out the spot and would plant some sweet flower,anapaestic,10,59,11,swswwswwswsw
which cupid snatch'd up to set fire to the bower,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswsswwsw
the taper burnt clear yet no leaf would consume,anapaestic,10,47,9,wsswswswsws
it just warm'd the buds and increas'd their perfume,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswswsws
hope ran from her covert to hymen she flew,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswsswswsw
your grove's in no danger 'tis sacred to you,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
my torch for the purpose i've dipp'd in a flame,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
'twas lit for a pair whose one wish is the same,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
while this sweet wish to please circles thro' every day,anapaestic,10,55,10,wwswswswswwsw
and the heart looking back shall perceive no decay,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswsswswswsw
kind relief in all my pain,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
jolly bacchus hear my pray'r,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
vengeance on th' ingrateful fair,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
in thy smiling cordial bowl,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws

all thy deity employ,trochaic,8,20,4,wwswsws
gild each gloomy thought with joy,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
jolly bacchus save oh save,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
from the deep devouring grave,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswswsw
a poor despairing dying swain,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
lash thy tigers do not stay,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
i'm undone if thou delay,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
if i view those eyes once more,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
still shall love and still adore,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
and be more wretched than before,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
see the glory round her face,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
see her move,trochaic,8,12,3,wsw
with what a grace,trochaic,8,17,4,wsws
ye gods above,trochaic,8,13,3,wsws
is she not one of your immortal race,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswswsws
fly ye winged cupids fly,trochaic,8,24,5,wswsws
dart like light'ning thro' the sky,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
you'd ye in marble temples dwell,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
the dear one to my arms compel,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsws
bring her in bands of myrtle tied,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
bid her forget and bid her hide,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
all her scorn and all her pride,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
wou'd ye that your slave repay,trochaic,8,30,6,wswwsws
a smoaking hecatomb each day,trochaic,8,28,5,wswswsws
the beauteous goddess i adore,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
o restore with all her charms,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
the faithless vagrant to my arms,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
while you my dear girls in your paradise stray,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
diverting with innocent freedom the day,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswswsw
i wander alone in a barbarous land,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswswsw
half bak'd by the sun half blind by the sand,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswsws
then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswsswswsw
they give me no respite by day nor by night,anapaestic,10,43,10,swswsswswsw
no sooner asleep but i'm dreaming of you,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
i am just wak'd from one wou'd to god it were true,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswwswswsw
methought i was now a fine gentleman grown,anapaestic,10,42,8,sswswswswsw
and had got lord knows how an estate of my own,anapaestic,10,46,11,wwswswswswsw
goodbye to plain tom i was rais'd a peg higher,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
some call'd me his worship and others the squire,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
'twas a place i remember exactly like easton,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswswsw
a scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswwswswswsw
there i built a fine house with great cost and great care,anapaestic,10,57,12,wwswswswswsw
your la'ships have form'd many such in the air,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
not of stucco nor brick but as good portland stone,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwsswswswsws
as kent wou'd desire to be working upon,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswsswwswsw
the apartments not small nor monstrously great,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswswsw
but chiefly for use and a little for state,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
so begilt and becarv'd and with ornaments grac'd,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswwswsw
that ev'ry one said i'd an excellent taste,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
here i liv'd like a king never hoarded my pelf,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswswsw
kept a coach for my sisters a nag for myself,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswsswswss
with something that's good when our highclear friends come,anapaestic,10,58,9,wswswswsswsw
and spite of 'squire herbert a fire in each room,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswsswsw
a canal made for profit as well as for pleasure,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswsswswwsw
that's about let me see two acres in measure,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswsswsw
both the eye to delight and the table to crown,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswwswsw
with a jack or a perch when my uncles come down,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswswswswsw
an exceeding great wood that's been set a great while,anapaestic,10,53,10,swswswswswsw
in length near a league and in breadth near a mile,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
there ev'ry dear girl her bright genius displays,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswswsw
in a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswswswswsw
o how charming the walks to my fancy appear,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
what a number of temples and grottos are here,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswswsw
my soul was transported to such an extreme,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswswsws
that i leap'd up in raptures when lo 'twas a dream,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswwswswsws
then vexing i chid the impertinent day,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswsw
for driving so sweet a delusion away,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswswsw
thus spectres arise as by nursemaids we're told,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
and hie to the place where they buried their gold,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
there hov'ring around until morning remain,anapaestic,10,42,6,wswsswswsws
then sadly return to their torments again,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswswsw
ye shepherds who sport on the plain,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
my heart was a stranger to pain,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
when deck'd with his pipe and his crook,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswsws
so sweetly the shepherd did look,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
but alas t'other day at the fair,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswswsw
he bought ribbons for phillis's hair,anapaestic,10,36,6,swsswswsw
sweet songs to beguile the dull hours,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
a posie of mayblowing flowers,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswsswsw
last week as they sat in the grove,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
their converse i'm sure was of love,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
i heard the soft words that he sung,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
each accent that fell from his tongue,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
my charmer said he is more fair,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
what's thyme with her breath to compare,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswsws
the rose when compar'd with her cheek,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsw
when sol thro' a shower doth break,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsw
alas if they never had met,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswwswsw
i wish he would phillis forget,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
each day wou'd i sing thro' the grove,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
but if he has settled his love,anapaestic,10,30,7,wwswswsw
adieu to contentment and rest,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
for i fear i can never be bless'd,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswswsw
to the grave will i carry my truth,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
be careful to shun the false youth,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
come join all ye nymphs of the grove,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
at length i have conquer'd my love,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
my bow'r shall with chaplets be dress'd,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswsw
for my bosom no more is oppress'd,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
oh jealousy merciless foe,anapaestic,10,25,4,wsswswsw
each day was a compound of woe,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
i envied the nymphs and the swains,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
because they were strangers to pain,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswwswsw
young daphne the sprightly and gay,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
with damon did wantonly play,anapaestic,10,28,5,wsswswsw
i fear'd that her charms would beguile,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
i could not allow him to smile,anapaestic,10,30,7,wwswswsw
gay colin by all is approv'd,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
he has often declar'd that he lov'd,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
but why do i muse on past woe,anapaestic,10,29,8,wswswsws
what blessing can heaven bestow,anapaestic,10,31,5,wsswssws
no danger or peril i fear,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswswsws
while bless'd in the smiles of my dear,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
together we sport all the day,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
or else o'er the meadows we stray,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
adieu to all anguish and care,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswwswsw
no longer will delia despair,anapaestic,10,28,5,wswswsws
then join all ye nymphs of the grove,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
ye shepherds so cheerful and gay,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
whose flocks never carelessly roam,anapaestic,10,34,5,swswswsw
should corydon's happen to stray,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
oh call the poor wanderers home,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswsw
allow me to muse and to sigh,anapaestic,10,28,7,wswswsws
nor talk of the change that ye find,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
none once was so watchful as i,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
i have left my dear phyllis behind,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswssws
now i know what it is to have strove,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
with the torture of doubt and desire,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswswsw
what it is to admire and to love,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
and to leave her we love and admire,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
ah lead forth my flock in the morn,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
and the damps of each ev'ning repell,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
alas i am faint and forlorn,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswswsws
i have bade my dear phyllis farewell,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswssws
since phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
i never once dreamt of my vine,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
may i lose both my pipe and my crook,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
if i knew of a kid that was mine,anapaestic,10,32,9,swswswsws
i priz'd every hour that went by,anapaestic,10,32,7,swsswswsws
beyond all that had pleas'd me before,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswwswsws
but now they are past and i sigh,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
and i grieve that i priz'd them no more,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
but why do i languish in vain,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswwswsw
why wander thus pensively here,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
oh why did i come from the plain,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
where i fed on the smiles of my dear,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
they tell me my favourite maid,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwswsw
the pride of that valley is flown,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
alas where with her i have stray'd,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
i could wander with pleasure alone,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
when forc'd the fair nymph to forego,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
what anguish i felt at my heart,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
yet i thought but it might not be so,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
'twas with pain that she saw me depart,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswswsws
she gaz'd as i slowly withdrew,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwssws
my path i could hardly discern,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
so sweetly she bade me adieu,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
i thought that she bade me return,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
the pilgrim that journeys all day,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
to visit some fardistant shrine,anapaestic,10,31,5,wsswswsw
if he bear but a relique away,anapaestic,10,29,7,swswswsws
is happy nor heard to repine,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
thus widely remov'd from the fair,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
where my vows my devotion i owe,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswswsw
soft hope is the relique i bear,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
and my solace wherever i go,anapaestic,10,27,6,wwsswswsw
my banks they are furnish'd with bees,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswwswsw
whose murmur invites one to sleep,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
my grottos are shaded with trees,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
and my hills are whiteover with sheep,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
i seldom have met with a loss,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
such health do my fountains bestow,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
my fountains all border'd with moss,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
where the harebells and violets grow,anapaestic,10,36,6,wwsswswsw
not a pine in my grove is there seen,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
but with tendrils of woodbine is bound,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
not a beech's more beautiful green,anapaestic,10,34,6,wwsswswsw
but a sweetbriar twines it around,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
not my fields in the prime of the year,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
more charms than my cattle unfold,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwssws
not a brook that is limpid and clear,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
but it glitters with fishes of gold,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwsswswsw
one would think she might like to retire,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
to the bow'r i have labour'd to rear,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswswsw
not a shrub that i heard her admire,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
but i hasted and planted it there,anapaestic,10,33,7,wwsswswsw
o how sudden the jessamin strove,anapaestic,10,32,6,wwsswswsw
with the lilac to render it gay,anapaestic,10,31,7,wwsswswsw
already it calls for my love,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswsws
to prune the wild branches away,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
from the plains from the woodlands and groves,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswsw
what strains of wild melody flow,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswsw
how the nightingales warble their loves,anapaestic,10,39,6,swswswsws
from thickets of roses that blow,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
and when her bright form shall appear,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
each bird shall harmoniously join,anapaestic,10,33,5,swswswsws
in a concert so soft and so clear,anapaestic,10,33,8,swswswsws
as she may not be fond to resign,anapaestic,10,32,8,swswswsws
i have found out a gift for my fair,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
i have found where the woodpigeons breed,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsw
but let me that plunder forbear,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
she will say 'twas a barbarous deed,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
for he ne'er could be true she aver'd,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
who could rob a poor bird of its young,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
and i lov'd her the more when i heard,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
such tenderness fall from her tongue,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
i have heard her with sweetness unfold,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
how that pity was due to a dove,anapaestic,10,31,8,swswswsws
that it ever attended the bold,anapaestic,10,30,6,wwsswswsw
and she call'd it the sister of love,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
but her words such a pleasure convey,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswssws
so much i her accents adore,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswswsws
let her speak and whatever she say,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
methinks i should love her the more,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
can a bosom so gentle remain,anapaestic,10,28,6,swswswsws
unmov'd when her corydon sighs,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswwswsw
will a nymph that is fond of the plain,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
these plains and this valley despise,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswwssws
dear regions of silence and shade,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
soft scenes of contentment and ease,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsw
where i could have pleasingly stray'd,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswwswsw
if aught in her absence could please,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswwswsw
but where does my phyllida stray,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswwswsw
and where are her grots and her bow'rs,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
are the groves and the valleys as gay,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
and the shepherds as gentle as ours,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwsswswsw
the groves may perhaps be as fair,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
and the face of the valleys as fine,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
the swains may in manners compare,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwssws
but their love is not equal to mine,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
why will you my passion reprove,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwssws
why term it a folly to grieve,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswwswsw
ere i shew you the charms of my love,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
she is fairer than you can believe,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
with her mien she enamours the brave,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsw
with her wit she engages the free,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
with her modesty pleases the grave,anapaestic,10,34,6,wwsswswsw
she is ev'ry way pleasing to me,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsws
o you that have been of her train,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
come and join in my amorous lays,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
i could lay down my life for the swain,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
that will sing but a song in her praise,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
when he sings may the nymphs of the town,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
come trooping and listen the while,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
nay on him let not phillida frown,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
but i cannot allow her to smile,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswswsw
for when paridel tries in the dance,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
any favour with phyllis to find,anapaestic,10,31,6,swsswswsw
o how with one trivial glance,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswwswsw
might she ruin the peace of my mind,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
in ringlets he dresses his hair,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
and his crook is bestudded around,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswssws
and his pipe oh may phyllis beware,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswssws
of a magic there is in the sound,anapaestic,10,32,8,swswswsws
'tis his with mock passion to glow,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsw
'tis his in smooth tales to unfold,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
how her face is as bright as the snow,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
and her bosom be sure is as cold,anapaestic,10,32,8,swswswsws
how the nightingales labour the strain,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
with the notes of his charmer to vie,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
how they vary their accents in vain,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwsswswsw
repine at her triumphs and die,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwswsw
to the grove or the garden he strays,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
and pillages every sweet,anapaestic,10,24,4,wsswswsw
then suiting the wreath to his lays,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
he throws it at phyllis's feet,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwswsw
o phyllis he whispers more fair,anapaestic,10,31,6,wsswswsw
more sweet than the jessamin's flow'r,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswsws
what are pinks in a morn to compare,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
what is eglantine after a show'r,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswswsw
then the lily no longer is white,anapaestic,10,32,7,wwsswswsw
then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
then the violets die with despight,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
and the woodbines give up their perfume,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
thus glide the soft numbers along,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
and he fancies no shepherd his peer,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
yet i never should envy the song,anapaestic,10,32,7,wwsswswsw
were not phyllis to lend it an ear,anapaestic,10,34,8,swswswsws
let his crook be with hyacinths bound,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsw
so phyllis the trophy despise,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswssws
let his forehead with laurels be crown'd,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswsws
so they shine not in phillis's eyes,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
the language that flows from the heart,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
is a stranger to paridel's tongue,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
yet may she beware of his art,anapaestic,10,29,7,wwswswsw
or sure i must envy the song,anapaestic,10,28,7,wswwswsw
ye shepherds give ear to my lay,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
and take no more heed of my sheep,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
they have nothing to do but to stray,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
i have nothing to do but to weep,anapaestic,10,32,8,swswswsws
yet do not my folly reprove,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswwssws
she was fair and my passion begun,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswssws
she smil'd and i could not but love,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
she is faithless and i am undone,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsws
perhaps i was void of all thought,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
perhaps it was plain to foresee,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
that a nymph so compleat would be sought,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsw
by a swain more engaging than me,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
ah love ev'ry hope can inspire,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
it banishes wisdom the while,anapaestic,10,28,5,wsswswsw
and the lip of the nymph we admire,anapaestic,10,34,8,swswswsws
seems for ever adorn'd with a smile,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
ye that witness the woes i endure,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
let reason instruct you to shun,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
what it cannot instruct you to cure,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
beware how ye loiter in vain,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswwswsw
amid nymphs of an higher degree,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswssws
it is not for me to explain,anapaestic,10,27,7,wswswsws
how fair and how fickle they be,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
alas from the day that we met,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
what hope of an end to my woes,anapaestic,10,30,8,wswswsws
when i cannot endure to forget,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsws
the glance that undid my repose,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
yet time may diminish the pain,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsw
the flow'r and the shrub and the tree,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
which i rear'd for her pleasure in vain,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
in time may have comfort for me,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
the sound of a murmuring stream,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
the peace which from solitude flows,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswwswsw
henceforth shall be corydon's theme,anapaestic,10,35,5,wswwswsw
high transports are shewn to the sight,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
but we are not to find them our own,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
fate never bestow'd such delight,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
as i with my phyllis had known,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
o ye woods spread your branches apace,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
to your deepest recesses i fly,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsws
i would hide with the beasts of the chace,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
i would vanish from every eye,anapaestic,10,29,6,wwsswswsw
yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswsw
with the same sad complaint it begun,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsw
how she smil'd and i could not but love,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
was faithless and i am undone,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
pretty nymph within this shade,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
whilst the flocks to rest are laid,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
whilst the world dissolves in heat,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
take this cool and flow'ry seat,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
and with pleasing talk a while,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
let us two the time beguile,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
tho' thou here no shepherd see,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
to encline his humble knee,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
or with melancholy lays,trochaic,8,23,4,wwswsws
sing thy dangerous beauty's praise,trochaic,8,34,5,wswswsws
nymph with thee i here wou'd stay,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
but have heard that on this day,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
near those beeches scarce in view,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
all the swains some mirth pursue,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
to whose meeting now i haste,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
solitude do's life but waste,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
prithee but a moment stay,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
no my chaplet wou'd decay,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
ev'ry drooping flow'r wou'd mourn,trochaic,8,33,5,swswswsw
and wrong the face they shou'd adorn,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
i can tell thee tho' so fair,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
and dress'd with all that rural care,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
most of the admiring swains,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
will be absent from the plains,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
gay sylvander in the dance,trochaic,8,26,5,wswswsw
meeting with a shrew'd mischance,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
to his cabin's now confin'd,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
by mopsus who the strain did bind,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
damon through the woods do's stray,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
where his kids have lost their way,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
young narcissus iv'ry brow,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
rac'd by a malicious bough,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
keeps the girilish boy from sight,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
till time shall do his beauty right,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
where's alexis,trochaic,8,14,2,swsw
lies extended on the grass,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
tears his garland raves despairs,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
mirth and harmony forswears,trochaic,8,27,4,swswsws
since he was this morning shown,trochaic,8,31,6,wswwsws
that delia must not be his own,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsws
foolish swain such love to place,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
on any but dorinda's face,trochaic,8,25,5,wswswsws
hasty nymph i said not so,trochaic,8,25,6,swswsws
no but i thy meaning know,trochaic,8,25,6,wswwsws
ev'ry shepherd thou wou'd'st have,trochaic,8,33,5,swswsws
not thy lover but thy slave,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
to encrease thy captive train,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
never to be lov'd again,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
but since all are now away,trochaic,8,26,6,wswwsws
no the strangers from the vale,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
sure will not this meeting fail,trochaic,8,31,6,wswwsws
graceful one the other fair,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
he too with the pensive air,trochaic,8,27,6,wswwsws
told me ere he came this way,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
he was wont to look more gay,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
see how pride thy heart inclines,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsw
to think for thee that shepherd pines,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
when those words that reach'd thy ear,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsw
chloe was design'd to hear,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
chloe who did near thee stand,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
and his more speaking looks command,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
now thy envy makes me smile,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
that indeed were worth his while,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
chloe next thyself decay'd,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
and no more a courted maid,trochaic,8,26,6,wswwsws
next myself young nymph forbear,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsw
still the swains allow me fair,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
tho' not what i was that day,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
when colon bore the prize away,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
till all the evening sports are past,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
till no streak of light is seen,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
nor footstep prints the flow'ry green,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsws
what thou wert i need not know,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
what i am must haste to show,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
only this i now discern,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
from the things thou'd'st have me learn,trochaic,8,39,7,wswswsw
that womankind's peculiar joys,trochaic,8,30,4,wswswsws
from past or present beauties rise,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
ye nymphs ah give ear to my lay,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswsws
for damon the youthful and gay,anapaestic,10,30,6,wsswswsw
that shepherd so blithsome and fair,anapaestic,10,35,6,wsswswsw
has left us alas in despair,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswswsws
his life was a compound of joy,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
no envy his bliss cou'd annoy,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
he scorn'd to deceive or betray,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
he always was blithsome and gay,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
in the shade when reclin'd on his crook,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
my flocks i have often forsook,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
each bird did attend on the spray,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
sweet harmony join'd the soft lay,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
my lambkins are straying far wide,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
my crook is with scorn thrown aside,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
i will riffle the jessamin bow'rs,anapaestic,10,33,6,wwsswswsw
with myrtle and sweet scented flow'rs,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswswsws
while eglantine sheds a perfume,anapaestic,10,31,5,wswswsws
while the cowslip continues to bloom,anapaestic,10,36,6,wwsswswsw
while the lambkins shall graze on the plain,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswsws
as long as old time shall remain,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
but alas the lov'd youth is no more,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
each shepherd the loss shall deplore,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
since truth like my damon's must yield,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswwswsw
ye swains ah make virtue your shield,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsw
a drunken old scot by the rigorous sentence,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsswsw
of the kirk was condemn'd to the stool of repentance,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswswsw
mess john to his conscience his vices put home,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
and his danger in this and the world that's to come,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswsw
thou reprobate mortal why dost not thou know,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
whither after your death all you drunkards must go,anapaestic,10,50,9,swswswswswsw
must go when we're dead why sir you may swear,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswsws
we shall go one and all where we find the best beer,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswswswwswsw
give me o indulgent fate,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
give me yet before i dye,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws
a sweet but absolute retreat,trochaic,8,28,5,wswswsws
'mongst paths so lost and trees so high,trochaic,8,39,8,wswswsws
that the world may ne'er invade,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
through such windings and such shade,trochaic,8,36,6,wwswsws
my unshaken liberty,trochaic,8,19,3,swswsws
no intruders thither come,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
who visit but to be from home,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsws
none who their vain moments pass,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
only studious of their glass,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
news that charm to listning ears,trochaic,8,32,6,swswswsw
that false alarm to hopes and fears,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
that common theme for every fop,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswswswsw
from the statesman to the shop,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
in those coverts ne'er be spread,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsw
of who's deceas'd or who's to wed,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
be no tidings thither brought,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
but silent as a midnight thought,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
where the world may ne'er invade,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
be those windings and that shade,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
courteous fate afford me there,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsws
a table spread without my care,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
with what the neighb'ring fields impart,trochaic,8,39,6,wswswsws
whose cleanliness be all it's art,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
when of old the calf was drest,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
tho' to make an angel's feast,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
in the plain unstudied sauce,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
nor treufle nor morillia was,trochaic,8,28,5,wswswswsw
nor cou'd the mighty patriarch's board,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswswsw
one farfetch'd ortolane afford,trochaic,8,30,4,wswswsws
courteous fate then give me there,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
only plain and wholesome fare,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
fruits indeed wou'd heaven bestow,trochaic,8,33,5,swswssws
all that did in eden grow,trochaic,8,25,6,wswwsws
all but the forbidden tree,trochaic,8,26,5,wswswsw
wou'd be coveted by me,trochaic,8,22,5,swswsws
grapes with juice so crouded up,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
as breaking thro' the native cup,trochaic,8,32,6,wswswsws
figs yet growing candy'd o'er,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
by the sun's attracting pow'r,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswswsw
cherries with the downy peach,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
all within my easie reach,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
whilst creeping near the humble ground,trochaic,8,38,6,wswswsws
shou'd the strawberry be found,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsw
springing wheresoe'er i stray'd,trochaic,8,31,4,swswsws
thro' those windings and that shade,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
for my garments let them be,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
what may with the time agree,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwsws
warm when phoebus does retire,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
and is illsupply'd by fire,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswswsw
but when he renews the year,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
and verdant all the fields appear,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
beauty every thing resumes,trochaic,8,26,4,swswswsws
birds have dropt their winterplumes,trochaic,8,35,5,swswsws
when the lilly full display'd,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
stands in purer white array'd,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
than that vest which heretofore,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
the luxurious monarch wore,trochaic,8,26,4,wswswsws
when from salem's gates he drove,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
to the soft retreat of love,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
lebanon's all burnish'd house,trochaic,8,29,4,swswsws
and the dear egyptian spouse,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
cloath me fate tho' not so gay,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
cloath me light and fresh as may,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
in the fountains let me view,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
all my habit cheap and new,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
such as when sweet zephyrs fly,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
with their motions may comply,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
gently waving to express,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
unaffected carelesness,trochaic,8,22,2,swswsw
no perfumes have there a part,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
borrow'd from the chymists art,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
but such as rise from flow'ry beds,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
or the falling jasmin sheds,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
'twas the odour of the field,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
esau's rural coat did yield,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
that inspir'd his father's pray'r,trochaic,8,33,5,wswswswsw
for blessings of the earth and air,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
of gums or pouders had it smelt,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
the supplanter then unfelt,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
easily had been descry'd,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
for one that did in tents abide,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
for some beauteous handmaids joy,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswsws
and his mother's darling boy,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
let me then no fragrance wear,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
but what the winds from gardens bear,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsws
in such kind surprizing gales,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
as gather'd from fidentia's vales,trochaic,8,33,5,wswswsws
all the flowers that in them grew,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
which intermixing as they flew,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsws
in wreathen garlands dropt agen,trochaic,8,31,5,wswsswsw
on lucullus and his men,trochaic,8,23,5,wswswsw
who chear'd by the victorious sight,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswswsws
trebl'd numbers put to flight,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
let me when i must be fine,trochaic,8,26,7,wswswsw
in such natural colours shine,trochaic,8,29,5,wwsswsws
wove and painted by the sun,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
whose resplendent rays to shun,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
when they do too fiercely beat,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
let me find some close retreat,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
where they have no passage made,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
give me there since heaven has shown,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
it was not good to be alone,trochaic,8,27,7,wswswsws
a partner suited to my mind,trochaic,8,27,6,wswswsws
solitary pleas'd and kind,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
who partially may something see,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsws
preferr'd to all the world in me,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
slighting by my humble side,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
fame and splendor wealth and pride,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
when but two the earth possest,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsw
'twas their happiest days and best,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsw
they by bus'ness nor by wars,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
they by no domestick cares,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
from each other e'er were drawn,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
but in some grove or flow'ry lawn,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
spent the swiftly flying time,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
spent their own and nature's prime,trochaic,8,34,6,wswwsws
in love that only passion given,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswswsw
to perfect man whilst friends with heaven,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswswsw
rage and jealousie and hate,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
transports of his fallen state,trochaic,8,30,5,wswwsws
when by satan's wiles betray'd,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
fly those windings and that shade,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
thus from crouds and noise remov'd,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
let each moment be improv'd,trochaic,8,27,5,swsswsw
every object still produce,trochaic,8,26,4,sswswsws
thoughts of pleasure and of use,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
when some river slides away,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
to encrease the boundless sea,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
think we then how time do's haste,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
to grow eternity at last,trochaic,8,24,5,wswswsws
by the willows on the banks,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
gather'd into social ranks,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
playing with the gentle winds,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
strait the boughs and smooth the rinds,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsw
moist each fibre and each top,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
wearing a luxurious crop,trochaic,8,24,4,swswswsw
let the time of youth be shown,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
the time alas too soon outgrown,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
whilst a lonely stubborn oak,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
which no breezes can provoke,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
no less gusts persuade to move,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
than those which in a whirlwind drove,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
spoil'd the old fraternal feast,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
and left alive but one poor guest,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
rivell'd the distorted trunk,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
sapless limbs all bent and shrunk,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
sadly does the time presage,trochaic,8,27,5,wswswsw
of our too near approaching age,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
when a helpless vine is found,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
unsupported on the ground,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
careless all the branches spread,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
subject to each haughty tread,trochaic,8,29,5,wswwsws
bearing neither leaves nor fruit,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
living only in the root,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
back reflecting let me say,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
so the sad ardelia lay,trochaic,8,22,5,wwswswsw
blasted by a storm of fate,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
felt thro' all the british state,trochaic,8,32,6,wswwsws
fall'n neglected lost forgot,trochaic,8,28,4,swswsws
dark oblivion all her lot,trochaic,8,25,5,swswswsw
faded till arminda's love,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
guided by the pow'rs above,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
warm'd anew her drooping heart,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
and life diffus'd thro' every part,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsw
mixing words in wise discourse,trochaic,8,30,5,wswswsw
of such weight and wond'rous force,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswsws
as could all her sorrows charm,trochaic,8,30,6,wswwsws
and transitory ills disarm,trochaic,8,26,4,wswswsws
chearing the delightful day,trochaic,8,27,4,sswswsws
when dispos'd to be more gay,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
with wit from an unmeasured store,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
to woman ne'er allow'd before,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
what nature or refining art,trochaic,8,27,5,wswswsws
all that fortune cou'd impart,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
heaven did to arminda send,trochaic,8,26,5,sswswsws
then gave her for ardelia's friend,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswswsw
to her cares the cordial drop,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
which else had overflow'd the cup,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
so when once the son of jess,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
every anguish did oppress,trochaic,8,25,4,sswswsws
hunted by all kinds of ills,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
like a partridge on the hills,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
trains were laid to catch his life,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
baited with a royal wife,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
from his house and country torn,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
made a heathen prince's scorn,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
fate to answer all these harms,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
threw a friend into his arms,trochaic,8,28,6,wswswsw
friendship still has been design'd,trochaic,8,34,5,swswsws
the support of humankind,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
the safe delight the useful bliss,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
the next world's happiness and this,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
give then o indulgent fate,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
give a friend in that retreat,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
tho' withdrawn from all the rest,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
still a clue to reach my breast,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
let a friend be still convey'd,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
where may i remain secure,trochaic,8,25,5,wwswsws
waste in humble joys and pure,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
a life that can no envy yield,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsws
want of affluence my shield,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
thus had crassus been content,trochaic,8,29,5,swsswsw
when from marius rage he went,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswswsw
with the seat that fortune gave,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
the commodious ample cave,trochaic,8,25,4,swsswsws
form'd in a divided rock,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
by some mighty earthquake's shock,trochaic,8,33,5,wwswsws
into rooms of every size,trochaic,8,24,5,wswswsws
fair as art cou'd e'er devise,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
leaving in the marble roof,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
'gainst all storms and tempests proof,trochaic,8,37,6,swswsws
only passage for the light,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
to refresh the chearful sight,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
whilst three sharers in his fate,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
on th' escape with joy dilate,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
beds of moss their bodies bore,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
canopy'd with ivy o'er,trochaic,8,22,4,swswsws
rising springs that round them play'd,trochaic,8,37,6,swswsws
o'er the native pavement stray'd,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswsws
when the hour arriv'd to dine,trochaic,8,29,6,wwsswsws
various meats and sprightly wine,trochaic,8,32,5,sswswsws
on some neighb'ring cliff they spy'd,trochaic,8,36,6,wwswsws
every day anew supply'd,trochaic,8,23,4,sswswsws
by a friend's entrusted care,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
had he still continu'd there,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
made that lonely wond'rous cave,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
both his palace and his grave,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
peace and rest he might have found,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
peace and rest are under ground,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
nor have been in that retreat,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
fam'd for a proverbial fate,trochaic,8,27,5,swswswsw
in pursuit of wealth been caught,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
and punish'd with a golden draught,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
nor had he who crowds cou'd blind,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsw
whisp'ring with a snowy hind,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
made 'em think that from above,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
like the great impostor's dove,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
tydings to his ears she brought,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
rules by which he march'd and fought,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
after spain he had o'errun,trochaic,8,26,5,wswswsw
cities sack'd and battles won,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
drove rome's consuls from the field,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
made her darling pompey yield,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
at a fatal treacherous feast,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswswsw
felt a dagger in his breast,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
had he his oncepleasing thought,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsws
of solitude to practice brought,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsws
had no wild ambition sway'd,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws

justly call'd the seats of rest,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
truly fortunate and blest,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
by the ancient poets giv'n,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
as their best discover'd heav'n,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
let me then indulgent fate,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
let me still in my retreat,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
from all roving thoughts be freed,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
or aims that may contention breed,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
nor be my endeavours led,trochaic,8,24,5,wwswsws
by goods that perish with the dead,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
fitly might the life of man,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
be indeed esteem'd a span,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
if the present moment were,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
of delight his only share,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
if no other joys he knew,trochaic,8,24,6,swswsws
than what round about him grew,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
but as those who stars wou'd trace,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
from a subterranean place,trochaic,8,25,4,wwswswsw
through some engine lift their eyes,trochaic,8,35,6,wwswsws
to the outward glorious skies,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswswsw
so th' immortal spirit may,trochaic,8,26,5,wswswsws

and things unutterable taught,trochaic,8,29,4,wswswsws
give me then in that retreat,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwsws
for all pleasures left behind,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
contemplations of the mind,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
let the fair the gay the vain,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw

whilst my transports i employ,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsw
on that more extensive joy,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
when all heaven shall be survey'd,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsw
from those windings and that shade,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswsws

cried my lord you'll excuse me but i have a reason,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwswwsw

i have there all along made my laura a goddess,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswswsw

to my cost i should find her no more than a woman,anapaestic,10,49,12,wwswswswswwsw
and my sonnets alas would gain credit with no man,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswsswsw
a lady sent lately to one doctor drug,anapaestic,10,37,8,wsswswswsws

this they owe to good order it must be allow'd,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
else men that are little are lost in a croud,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
so much for simile now to be brief,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsws
the following lines come to tell you my grief,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
'tis well i can write for i scarcely can speak,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
i'm so plagu'd with my teeth which eternally ake,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwsswswswswsw
when the wind's in the point which opposes the south,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswswswswsw
for fear of the cold i can't open my mouth,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswsw
and you know to the sex it must be a heartbreaking,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswswswsww
to have any distemper that keeps them from speaking,anapaestic,10,51,9,wwsswswswswsw
when first i was silent a day and a night,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswwswswsws
the women were all in a terrible fright,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
supplications to jove in an instant they make,anapaestic,10,45,8,swsswswwswsw
avert the portent a woman not speak,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsws
since poets are prophets and often have sung,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
the last thing that dies in a woman's her tongue,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
o jove for what crime is sapphira thus curst,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswsswsw
'tis plain by her breathing her tongue has dy'd first,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswwswswsws
ye powers celestial tell mortals what cause,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
occasions dame nature to break her own laws,anapaestic,10,43,8,wsswswswsws
did the preacher live now from his text he must run,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswsw
and own there was something new under the sun,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
o jove for the future this punishment spare,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
and all other evils we'll willingly bear,anapaestic,10,40,7,wwswswswsws
then they throng to my house and my maid they beseech,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswwswswsws
to say if her mistress had quite lost her speech,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
nell readily own'd what they heard was too true,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
that today i was dumb give the devil his due,anapaestic,10,44,10,swswswswswsw
and frankly confess'd were it always the case,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
no servant could e'er have a happier place,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
when they found it was fact they began all to fear me,anapaestic,10,53,12,wwswswswswwsw
and dreading infection would scarcely come near me,anapaestic,10,50,8,wsswswswswsw
till a neighbour of mine who was famous for speeching,anapaestic,10,53,10,wwswswswsswsw
bid them be of good cheer the disease was not catching,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswwswswswwsw
and offer'd to prove from authors good store,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswsws
that the like case with this never happen'd before,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswwswssws
and if ages to come should resemble the past,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw
as 'twas the first instance it would be the last,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
yet against this disorder we all ought to strive,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswwsw
were i in her case i'd been bury'd alive,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswssws
were i one moment silent except in my bed,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswsswswsw
my good natur'd husband would swear i was dead,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswswswsws
the next said her tongue was so much in her pow'r,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswwsw
she was sullenly silent almost half an hour,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwsswswswswsw
that to vex her good man she took this way to teaze him,anapaestic,10,55,13,wswswswswswsw
but soon left it off when she found it would please him,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswswswwsw
and vow'd for the future she'd make the housering,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswssw
for when she was dumb he did nothing but sing,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
quite tir'd with their talking i held down my head,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswwswswsws
so she who sat next me cry'd out i was dead,anapaestic,10,43,11,wswswswswsw
they call'd for cold water to throw in my face,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
give her air give her air and cut open her lace,anapaestic,10,47,11,swswswswswsw
says good neighbour nevil you're out of your wits,anapaestic,10,49,9,swsswswswsw
she oft to my knowledge has these sullen fits,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswwswswsws
let her husband come in and make one step that's wrong,anapaestic,10,54,11,swswswswswsw
my life for't the woman will soon find her tongue,anapaestic,10,49,10,swswsswswsw
you'll soon be convinc'd o' my conscience he's here,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswwswsw
why what's all this rout are you sullen my dear,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
this struck them all silent which gave me some ease,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswsws
and made them imagine they'd got my disease,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswswsws
so they hasted away in a terrible fright,anapaestic,10,40,8,swsswswwswsw
and left me in silence to pass the long night,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswwswswsws
not the women alone were scar'd at my fate,anapaestic,10,42,9,swsswswswsw
'twas reckon'd of dreadful portent to the state,anapaestic,10,47,8,wsswswswsws
when the governors heard it they greatly were troubled,anapaestic,10,54,9,wwswswswswsww
and whilst i was silent the guards were all doubled,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswswsw
the militia drums beat a perpetual alarm,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswswswsws
to rouze up the sons of the city to arm,anapaestic,10,39,10,wswswswswsw
a story was rumour'd about from lambey,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswsw
of a powerful fleet that was seen off at sea,anapaestic,10,44,10,wwswswswswsw
with horror all list to the terrible tale,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
the barristers tremble the judges grow pale,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
to the castle the frighted nobility fly,anapaestic,10,39,7,swsswsswswsw
and the council were summon'd they could not tell why,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswsswswsw
the clergy in crouds to the churches repair,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
and armies embattled were seen in the air,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
why they were in this fright i have lately been told,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswwswswswsw
it seems it was sung by a druid of old,anapaestic,10,38,10,wswswswswsw
that the hanover race to greatbritain should come,anapaestic,10,49,8,wwsswswswsws
and sit on the throne till a woman grew dumb,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
as soon as this prophecy reach'd the pretender,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswwswswswsw
he cry'd out my claim to the crown i surrender,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswwswswswsw
says richard to thomas and seem'd half afraid,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswsws
i am thinking to marry thy mistress's maid,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswsswswsw
now because mrs martha to thee is well known,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswwsw
i will do't if thou bidst me or let it alone,anapaestic,10,44,11,wwswwswswsws
nay don't make a jest on't 'tis no jest to me,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswswsw
for faith i'm in earnest so prithee be free,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
i have no fault to find with the girl since i knew her,anapaestic,10,54,13,wswswswwswwsw
but i'd have thy advice ere i tye myself to her,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswssww
said thomas to richard to speak my opinion,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswswswswsw
there is not such a bitch in king george's dominion,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswswsww
and i firmly believe if thou knew'st her as i do,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswwswwsw
thou would'st chuse out a whippingpost first to be ty'd to,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswswswsw
she's peevish she's thievish she's ugly she's old,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
and a lyar and a fool and a slut and a scold,anapaestic,10,44,12,wswswswwswsw
next day richard hasten'd to church and was wed,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswsw
and ere night had inform'd her what thomas had said,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswwswsw
grown old and grown stupid you just think me fit,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
to transcribe from my grandmother's book a receipt,anapaestic,10,50,8,swswswsswsws
and a comfort it is to a wight in distress,anapaestic,10,42,10,wwswswwswsws
he's of some little use but he can't be of less,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswsswswswsw
were greater his talents you might ever command,anapaestic,10,47,8,wsswswswssws
his head that's worth nought then his heart and his hand,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswswswsw
so your mandate obeying he sends you d'ye see,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswsswswsw
the genuine receipt to make l'eau de la vie,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswswsw
take seven large lemons and pare them as thin,anapaestic,10,45,9,wsswswswsws
as a wafer or what is yet thinner your skin,anapaestic,10,43,10,wwswswswswsw
a quart of french brandy or rum is still better,anapaestic,10,47,10,swswswswswsw
for you ne'er in receipts should stick close to the letter,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswswswsw
six ounces of sugar next take and pray mind,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
the sugar must be the best doublerefin'd,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
boil the sugar in near half a pint of spring water,anapaestic,10,50,11,swsswswswswsw
in the neat silver saucepan you bought for your daughter,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswswswswsw
but be sure that the syrup you carefully skim,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswsswsw
while the scum as 'tis call'd rises up to the brim,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswswswsw
the fourth part of a pint you next must allow,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswwsws
of new milk made as warm as it comes from the cow,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
put the rinds of the lemons the milk and the syrup,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswsswswwsw
with the rum in a jar and give 'em a stir up,anapaestic,10,44,12,wswswswswwsw
and if you approve it you may add some perfume,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswwswsws
goastone or whatever you like in its room,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswswsw
let it stand thus three days but remember to shake it,anapaestic,10,53,11,swswswswswsws
and the closer you stop it the richer you make it,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswsswsw
then filter'd thro' paper 'twill sparkle and rise,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
be as soft as your lips and as bright as your eyes,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
last bottle it up and believe me the vicar,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswwsw
of e himself ne'er drank better liquor,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswswsw
in a word it excels by a million of odds,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswwswsw
the nectar your sister presents to the gods,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswwswsws
while the sighing crowd admire,trochaic,8,30,5,wwswsws
all those dismal looks and fretting,trochaic,8,35,6,wwswswsw
long ago the worms have eat him,trochaic,8,31,7,swswswsw
once again consult your toilette,trochaic,8,32,5,swswswsw
so much weeping soon will spoil it,trochaic,8,34,7,wwswswsw
i like you was born a woman,trochaic,8,27,7,wswwswsw
the disease alas is common,trochaic,8,26,5,swswswsw
all the morals that they tell us,trochaic,8,32,7,wwswswsw
chuse among the pretty fellows,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
prithee hear him every morning,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsws
once again at night returning,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
all attendants apart,anapaestic,10,20,3,wswsws
i examin'd my heart,anapaestic,10,19,4,swswsw
last night when i lay'd me to rest,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
and methinks i'm inclin'd,anapaestic,10,25,4,wswsws
to a change of my mind,anapaestic,10,22,6,wswsws
for you know second thoughts are the best,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswsw
to retire from the crowd,anapaestic,10,24,5,swswsw
and make ourselves good,anapaestic,10,23,4,wswsw
by avoiding of every temptation,anapaestic,10,31,5,swsswswswsw
is in truth to reveal,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsws
what we'd better conceal,anapaestic,10,24,4,wwssws
that our passions want some regulation,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswswsw
it will much more redound,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswsws
to our praise to be found,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswsws
in a world so abounding with evil,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsws
unspotted and pure,anapaestic,10,18,3,wswsw
tho' not so demure,anapaestic,10,18,4,swsws
as to wage open war with the devil,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsws
then bidding farewell,anapaestic,10,21,3,wssws
to the thoughts of a cell,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswsws
i'll prepare for a militant life,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswwswsw
and if brought to distress,anapaestic,10,26,5,wswsws
why then i'll confess,anapaestic,10,21,4,wwsws
and do penance in shape of a wife,anapaestic,10,33,8,swswswsws
between nose and eyes a strange contest arose,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
the spectacles set them unhappily wrong,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswswsw
the point in dispute was as all the world knows,anapaestic,10,47,10,swswswwswsw
to which the said spectacles ought to belong,anapaestic,10,44,8,wwswswswsws
so the tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswsswsw
with a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswswswsw
while chief baron ear sat to balance the laws,anapaestic,10,45,9,swsswswswsw
so fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswsswsswsw
in behalf of the nose it will quickly appear,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswwswwssws
and your lordship he said will undoubtedly find,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswswsw
that the nose has had spectacles always in wear,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswsswsw
which amounts to possession time out of mind,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
then holding the spectacles up to the court,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
your lordship observes they are made with a straddle,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswswwsw
as wide as the ridge of the nose is in short,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswswswswsw
design'd to sit close to it just like a saddle,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswwsw
again would your lordship a moment suppose,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswssws
'tis a case that has happen'd and may be again,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswsswwsws
that the visage or countenance had not a nose,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwsswswswsws
pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
on the whole it appears and my argument shows,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswwswsw
with a reasoning the court will never condemn,anapaestic,10,45,8,wwswswswssws
that the spectacles plainly were made for the nose,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswswswsw
and the nose was as plainly intended for them,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsww
then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
he pleaded again in behalf of the eyes,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsw
but what were his arguments few people know,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswwswswsws
for the court did not think they were equally wise,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
so his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswssw
decisive and clear without one if or but,anapaestic,10,40,8,wsswswswsws
that whenever the nose put his spectacles on,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswswswsw
by daylight or candlelight eyes should be shut,anapaestic,10,46,8,wsswswswsws
the favours of fortune i once hop'd to gain,anapaestic,10,43,9,wsswswswsws
and often invok'd her but ever in vain,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsw
she despis'd my addresses which gave me such grief,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswsswswsw
i flew to the muses in hopes of relief,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswwswswsws
ah wretch that i was i might very well know,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
'twas the method to make her for ever my foe,anapaestic,10,44,10,swsswswwswsw
they laugh'd at the goddess and bid me despise her,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswwswswswsw
but time and experience have made me grow wiser,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswswsw
this unhappy mistake i resolve to repair,anapaestic,10,40,7,swsswswswsws
o fortune thy votaries must persevere,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswswwswsws
of old when scarron his companions invited,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswsswsw
each guest brought his dish and the feast was united,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsww
if oura landlord supplies us with beef and with fish,anapaestic,10,52,10,wsswswsswwswsw
let each guest bring himself and he brings the best dish,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswswwswsw
ourb dean shall be venison just fresh from the plains,anapaestic,10,53,10,sswswswswswsw
ourc burke shall be tongue with a garnish of brains,anapaestic,10,51,10,sswswswwswsw
ourd will shall be wild fowl of excellent flavour,anapaestic,10,49,9,sswwswswswsww
ande dick with his pepper shall heighten their savour,anapaestic,10,53,9,swswsswsswsw
ourf cumberland's sweetbread its place shall obtain,anapaestic,10,51,7,swswsswswsws
andg douglas is pudding substantial and plain,anapaestic,10,45,7,wsswswswsws
ourh garrick's a sallad for in him we see,anapaestic,10,41,9,swsswswswwsw
oil vinegar sugar and saltness agree,anapaestic,10,36,6,wsswswswsws
to make out the dinner full certain i am,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswsswswsw
thati ridge is anchovy andk reynolds is lamb,anapaestic,10,44,8,sswswsswswsw
thatl hickey's a capon and by the same rule,anapaestic,10,43,9,swsswswswwsw
magnanimous goldsmith a goosberry fool,anapaestic,10,38,5,wswswswswsw
at a dinner so various at such a repast,anapaestic,10,39,9,wwsswsswswsws
who'd not be a glutton and stick to the last,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
here waiter more wine let me sit while i'm able,anapaestic,10,47,10,wsswswswswsw
'till all my companions sink under the table,anapaestic,10,44,8,wwswswswswsw
then with chaos and blunders encircling my head,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwsswswswswsw
let me ponder and tell what i think of the dead,anapaestic,10,47,11,swswswswswsw
here lies the good dean reunited to earth,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
who mixt reason with pleasure and wisdom with mirth,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswsswswsw
if he had any faults he has left us in doubt,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswsswswswsw
at least in six weeks i could not find 'em out,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
yet some have declar'd and it can't be denied 'em,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
that slyboots was cursedly cunning to hide 'em,anapaestic,10,46,8,wsswswswsws
here lies our good edmund whose genius was such,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
we scarcely can praise it or blame it too much,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
who born for the universe narrow'd his mind,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswwswswsws
and to party gave up what was meant for mankind,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
tho' fraught with all learning yet straining his throat,anapaestic,10,55,9,wswswswswsw
to persuadem tommy townsend to lend him a vote,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswswswswsws
who too deep for his hearers still went on refining,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswswsw
and thought of convincing while they thought of dining,anapaestic,10,54,9,swswswswswsw
tho' equal to all things for all things unfit,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswwsws
too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
for a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwsswswswswsw
and too fond of the right to pursue the expedient,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswswsws
in short 'twas his fate unemploy'd or in place sir,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswwsw
to eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor,anapaestic,10,46,10,swsswswswwsw
here lies honest william whose heart was a mint,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswsws
while the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswsw
the pupil of impulse it forc'd him along,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswsswswsws
his conduct still right with his argument wrong,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
still aiming at honour yet fearing to roam,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswsswswsw
the coachman was tipsy the chariot drove home,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswsswsw
would you ask for his merits alas he had none,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswsswswsw
what was good was spontaneous his faults were his own,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswsswswsww
here lies honest richard whose fate i must sigh at,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswsswswwsw
alas that such frolic should now be so quiet,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswswsw
what spirits were his what wit and what whim,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswsws
n now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswswswsw
now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswswsw
now teazing and vexing yet laughing at all,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
in short so provoking a devil was dick,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswsswswsw
that we wish'd him full ten times a day at old nick,anapaestic,10,51,12,wwswswswswsw
but missing his mirth and agreeable vein,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
as often we wish'd to have dick back again,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
here cumberland lies having acted his parts,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
the terence of england the mender of hearts,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
a flattering painter who made it his care,anapaestic,10,41,8,wsswswswsws
to draw men as they ought to be not as they are,anapaestic,10,47,12,wswswswswsww
his gallants are all faultless his women divine,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswwssws
and comedy wonders at being so fine,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswswsw
like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
or rather like tragedy giving a rout,anapaestic,10,36,7,wsswsswswsw
his fools have their follies so lost in a crowd,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsw
and coxcombs alike in their failings alone,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswssws
adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
say where has our poet this malady caught,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswswsw
or wherefore his characters thus without fault,anapaestic,10,46,7,wsswswswsws
say was it that vainly directing his view,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
to find out mens virtues and finding them few,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
he grew lazy at last and drew from himself,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswswsws
here douglas retires from his toils to relax,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
the scourge of impostors the terror of quacks,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
come all ye quack bards and ye quacking divines,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswssws
come and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswwssws
when satire and censure encircled his throne,anapaestic,10,44,7,wsswswswswsw
i fear'd for your safety i fear'd for my own,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
but now he is gone and we want a detector,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswwswswswsw
our dodds shall be pious our kenricks shall lecture,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswwswswswsw
macpherson write bombast and call it a style,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
our townshend make speeches and i shall compile,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswsswswsws
new lauders and bowers the tweed shall cross over,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
no countryman living their tricks to discover,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswwswswsw
detection her taper shall quench to a spark,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
and scotchman meet scotchman and cheat in the dark,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
here lies david garrick describe me who can,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswsswswsw
an abridgment of all that was pleasant in man,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswswsw
as an actor confest without rival to shine,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswwsw
as a wit if not first in the very first line,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswswswwswsw
yet with talents like these and an excellent heart,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswswswsw
the man had his failings a dupe to his art,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
like an illjudging beauty his colours he spread,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswwsw
and beplaister'd with rouge his own natural red,anapaestic,10,47,8,wsswswswswsw
on the stage he was natural simple affecting,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswsswswssw
'twas only that when he was off he was acting,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswwswsw
with no reason on earth to go out of his way,anapaestic,10,44,11,swswswswswsw
he turn'd and he varied full ten times aday,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswwswswsws
tho' secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsw
if they were not his own by finessing and trick,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswwswswsw
he cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
for he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswwswsw
of praise a mere glutton he swallow'd what came,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswsw
and the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame,anapaestic,10,46,11,wwswswswswsw
'till his relish grown callous almost to disease,anapaestic,10,48,8,wwsswswswsws
who pepper'd the highest was surest to please,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswsswswsw
but let us be candid and speak out our mind,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
if dunces applauded he paid them in kind,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
ye kenricks ye kellys and woodfalls so grave,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
what a commerce was yours while you got and you gave,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
how did grubstreet reecho the shouts that you rais'd,anapaestic,10,52,9,wwswswswsws
while he was beroscius'd and you were beprais'd,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswswsw
but peace to his spirit wherever it flies,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswswsw
to act as an angel and mix with the skies,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswwswswsws
those poets who owe their best fame to his skill,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
shall still be his flatterers go where he will,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswwswswsws
old shakespeare receive him with praise and with love,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswswswsw
and beaumonts and bens be his kellys above,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswssws
here hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature,anapaestic,10,51,8,wsswswswswsw
and slander itself must allow him goodnature,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsws
he cherish'd his friend and he relish'd a bumper,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswsswsw
yet one fault he had and that one was a thumper,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswwsw
perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswwsw
i answer no no for he always was wiser,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswswsww
too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat,anapaestic,10,40,6,wswswswswwsw
his very worst foe can't accuse him of that,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
perhaps he confided in men as they go,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
and so was too foolishly honest ah no,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
then what was his failing come tell it and burn ye,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswwswswswsw
he was could he help it a special attorney,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswsswsw
here reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
he has not left a wiser or better behind,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswsswssws
his pencil was striking resistless and grand,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
his manners were gentle complying and bland,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
still born to improve us in every part,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswswwswsw
his pencil our faces his manners our heart,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
to coxcombs averse yet most civilly steering,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswsswsw
when they judg'd without skill he was still hard of hearing,anapaestic,10,59,11,wwswswswswsww
when they talk'd of their raphaels corregios and stuff,anapaestic,10,54,9,wwswwsswswsws
he shifted hiso trumpet and only took snuff,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsswsw
as damon was pensively walking one day,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswsw
three pretty tight lasses he met in his way,anapaestic,10,43,9,wsswswswsws
and who should they be that were taking the air,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
but nelly and molly and charlot so fair,anapaestic,10,39,8,wsswswswsws
the swain who to beauty had never been blind,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
thought this was the season to tell 'em his mind,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
but first he debated to which lovely lass,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswwsws
he should offer his tenders and open his case,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswswsw
that nelly was pretty he could not deny,anapaestic,10,39,8,wsswswswsws
but molly he thought had the sprightliest eye,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
so on her his affections they rested awhile,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswwssws
'till charlot appear'd with a look and a smile,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
with a look and a smile which sure mischief had done,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
had the swain been encounter'd by charlot alone,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsws
perplext in his thought and disturb'd in his breast,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsw
and unable to tell which bright lass he lov'd best,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswswswswsw
he folded his arms to the grove he retir'd,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsww
and decently on the green willow expir'd,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsswsw
for three at a time what poor mortal could bear,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
one alone trust me charlot had made him rejoice,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsws
and the swain been quite happy with what,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsw

if you pity your soul i pray listen to neither,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswsswsw
the first is in error the last a deceiver,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswwswswswsw

who while he talk'd gravely would hold forth his hand,anapaestic,10,53,10,wwswswswsws
dominion and wealth are the aim of all three,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw

by the side of the stream that strays thro' the grove,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswsw
i met in a ramble the blithe god of love,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswwswswsws
his bow o'er his shoulder was carelessly ty'd,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
his quiver in negligence clanck'd at his side,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswsws
a handful of arrows he held to my view,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswswsw
each wing'd with a feather of different hue,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswsswswsw
this fledg'd from the eagle he smiling begun,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswssws
i aim at the heart that no dangers will shun,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
and this from the peacock all gaudy array'd,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswwswswsws
the breast of sir fopling is sure to invade,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswsws
when i aim at the prattler who talks void of wit,anapaestic,10,48,11,wwswwswswsws
my shaft in the plume of a parrot will hit,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswswsw
and when i've a mind that the jealous should smart,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
i pierce with an owlfeather'd arrow his heart,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
for the youth in whom truth and fondness reside,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
from the breast of a dove my dart is supply'd,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswswswsws
this i value the most 'twas this that i found,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswswswsws
from you o my delia that gave me the wound,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
phoebe thank thy false heart it has fix'd my repose,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsws
the gods have had pity at length on my woes,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
i feel it i feel my soul loose from its chain,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswswsw
and at last freedom comes often dream'd of in vain,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswsswswsw
the flame is burn'd out and each passion at rest,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswswswsws
no more when thou'rt nam'd the warm blushes arise,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswsswswssws
no more slutters my heart when i meet with your eyes,anapaestic,10,52,11,swsswswwswsw
in my sleep now no longer thy image i see,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswswswwsw
nor the first of my thoughts when i wake is of thee,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswswswswsww
when from thee no more of thy absence i plain,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
when with thee i feel neither pleasure nor pain,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
my heart without fondness can muse on thy charms,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
my past pains i recount yet no passion alarms,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswwssws
discompos'd i'm no longer when tow'rd me you move,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswswsws
and at ease with my rival i talk of my love,anapaestic,10,43,11,wswswsswswsw
whether haughty thy frown whether gentle thy strain,anapaestic,10,51,8,swswswswswsw
in vain thy proud looks thy fond speeches in vain,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsww
no more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
whether pensive or cheerful no longer to you,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswswswsw
for this are my thanks or for that my blame due,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
the gay prospect now pleases though you are away,anapaestic,10,48,9,swsswswswsws
and your presence no more can make dreariness gay,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
believe me i still can allow that thou'rt fair,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswssw
but not that no fairone can with thee compare,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswsws
and though beauteous i own thee yet still in thy face,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswwswsw
i can now spy a fault which i once thought a grace,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
when first the fix'd arrow i pluck'd from my heart,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswsswswsw
oh methought i shou'd die so severe was the smart,anapaestic,10,49,10,wsswswswswsw
but from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswswswswssw
torments greater than dying with patience i'd bear,anapaestic,10,50,8,swsswsswswsw
when lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswswsw
nor regrets the lost plume so his freedom he gains,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswswswswsw
the loss of his plumage small time will restore,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswwswswsws
and once try'd the false twig it can cheat him no more,anapaestic,10,54,12,wswswswwswsw
the old flame never flatter yourself to believe,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswsswswsw
while it dwells on my tongue in my heart still must live,anapaestic,10,56,12,wswswswwswsw
our dangers when past with delight we repeat,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
what in suffering was pain to remembrance is sweet,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwsswswswswsw
'tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
he fights o'er his old battles and vaunts of his scars,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswsswswsw
with pleasure the captive his liberty gain'd,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
the fetters thus shows which once held him enchain'd,anapaestic,10,52,9,wsswswswsws
thus i talk and i still will talk on while i may,anapaestic,10,48,12,wswswswswsww
nor heed i though you disbelieve what i say,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
i ask not that phoebe my talk should approve,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswsws
let her too if she can talk at ease of my love,anapaestic,10,46,12,wswswwswswsw
an inconstant i leave a true lover you lose,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswswsw
which first of us two will have comfort who knows,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
this i know phoebe ne'er such a true love will find,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswwswsw
i can easily meet with a fair as unkind,anapaestic,10,39,9,wwswswswswsw
good madam when ladies are willing,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswsswsw
a man must needs look like a fool,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
for me i wou'd not give a shilling,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
for one that is kind out of rule,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
at least you might stay for my offer,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
not snatch like old maids in despair,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
if you've liv'd to these years without proffer,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswsws
your sighs are now lost in the air,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
you might leave me to guess by your blushing,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswsw
and not speak the matter so plain,anapaestic,10,33,7,wwswswsw
'tis ours to pursue and be pushing,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsws
'tis yours to affect a disdain,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
that you're in a pitiful taking,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwsswsw
by all your sweet ogles i see,anapaestic,10,29,7,wwswswsw
but the fruit that will fall without shaking,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswsws
indeed is too mellow for me,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswswsws
too poor for a bribe and too proud to importune,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsws
he had not the method of making a fortune,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswsswsswsw
could love and could hate so was thought somewhat odd,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswswsw
no very great wit he believed in a god,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswswsw
a post or a pension he did not desire,anapaestic,10,37,9,wswwswswswsw
but left church and state to charles townshend and squire,anapaestic,10,57,10,wswswswswsw
sweet companion of the muse,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
gentle solitude appear,trochaic,8,22,3,swswsws
all thy calm content infuse,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
soften anguish banish care,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
lead me o majestic queen,trochaic,8,24,5,swswsws
thro' the aromatic scene,trochaic,8,24,4,swswsws
nature's copied here by art,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
joyful we the fraud confess,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
yet so well performs her part,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
'tis but nature's better dress,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
solitude here fix my seat,trochaic,8,25,5,swswsws
here in cowley's soft retreat,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
lay me in the silent mead,trochaic,8,25,6,wswwsws
where the murmuring river flows,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
where the elm expands the shade,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
and each rising beauty blows,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
there i'll say in peace of mind,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
empty greatness fall behind,trochaic,8,27,4,swswsws
teach thy votary all the powers,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsws
of each plant and every tree,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswswsw
tell how shortliv'd are the flowers,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
bring the moral home to me,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
bid me fleeting life despise,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
make me humble make me wise,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
pride within my lowly cell,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
never yet uprear'd her head,trochaic,8,27,5,sswswsws
solitude with thee i'll dwell,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
pride with me is long since dead,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
cold to pleasure deaf to praise,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
here i wish to end my days,trochaic,8,26,7,wswswsw
how fondly i gaze on the fast fallingleaves,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswssws
that mark as i wander the summer's decline,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswssws
and then i exclaim while my conscious heart heaves,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
thus early to droop and to perish be mine,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
yet once i remember in moments long past,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
most dear to my sight was the spring's opening bloom,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswwswswswsw
but then my youth's spring sorrow had not o'ercast,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
nor taught me with fondness to look on the tomb,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
fair spring now no longer these grieffaded eyes,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
thy rich glowing beauties with pleasure can see,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswwsw
thy pale sickly hues chilly autumn i prize,anapaestic,10,42,8,swsswswswsw
they suit blighted hopes and are emblems of me,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswswwswsw
where dost thou bide blessed soul of my love,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswsws
is ether thy dwelling o whisper me where,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
rapt in remembrance while lonely i rove,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswsws
i gaze on bright clouds and i fancy thee there,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
or to thy bower when musing i go,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsws
i think 't is thy voice that i hear in the breeze,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
softly it seems to speak peace to my woe,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswswsw
and life once again for a moment can please,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswwswsw
if this be phrensy alone 't is so dear,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswswsw
that long may the pleasing delusion be nigh,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
still ellen's voice in the breeze may i hear,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswsws
still see in bright clouds the kind beams of her eye,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
low hung the dark clouds on plinlimmon's tall peak,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
and slowly yet surely the winter drew near,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
when ellen sweet ellen a tear on her cheek,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswsws
exclaimed as we parted in may i'll be here,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswwswswsws
how swiftly i ran up the mountain's steep height,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
to catch the last glimpse of an object so dear,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
and when i no longer could keep her in sight,anapaestic,10,44,10,wwswswswsws
i thought on her promise in may i'll be here,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
now gladly i mark from plinlimmon's tall peak,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
the lowhanging vapours and clouds disappear,anapaestic,10,43,6,wsswswswsws
and climb the rough mountain thence ellen to seek,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
repeating her promise in may i'll be here,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
but vainly i gaze the wide prospect around,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswssws
't is may yet no ellen returning is near,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswsswswsw
oh when shall i see her when feel my heart bound,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
as sweetly she cries it is may and i'm here,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
you ask why these mountains delight me no more,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
and why lovely clwyd's attractions are o'er,anapaestic,10,43,7,wwswswswswsw
ah have you not heard then the cause of my pain,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
the pride of fair clwyd the boast of the plain,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
we never no never shall gaze on again,anapaestic,10,37,8,wsswswswsws
what though from her coldness keen anguish i felt,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
and vainly to move her in agony knelt,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
yet could i restore her i'd never complain,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswwssws
not e'en though she doomed me to endless disdain,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswwswsw
i'd bear any torture to see her again,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswswsws
i grieved when on others with kindness she gazed,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsw
i mourned when another with pleasure she praised,anapaestic,10,48,8,swswsswswsw
but could i recall her to life by my pain,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswswswsw
i'd urge her to favour some happier swain,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswswsw
and wish no reward but to see her again,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswswsws
those beauties that charmed me from death i would free,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswswsw
though sure that those beauties another's should be,anapaestic,10,51,8,wswswswswsw
but truth and affection and grief are all vain,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
the pride of fair clwyd the boast of our plain,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
we never ah never can gaze on again,anapaestic,10,35,8,wsswswswsws
in a vale fring'd with woodland where grottos abound,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswwssws
and rivulets murmur and echoes resound,anapaestic,10,38,6,wswswswssws
i vow'd to the muses my time and my care,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswwswswsws
since neither could win me the smiles of my fair,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
as freedom inspir'd me i rang'd and i sung,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswwswsw
and daphne's dear name never fell from my tongue,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
and if once a smooth accent delighted my ear,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw
i should wish unawares that my daphne might hear,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswwswsw
with fairest ideas my bosom i stor'd,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswswsw
allusions to none but the nymph i ador'd,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
and the more i with study my fancy refin'd,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswsswswsw
the deeper impressions she made on my mind,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
ah whilst i the beauties of nature pursue,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswssws
i still must my daphne's fair image renew,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswssws
the graces have chosen with daphne to rove,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswswswsws
and the muses are all in alliance with love,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
yes these are the scenes where with iris i stray'd,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
but short was her sway for so lovely a maid,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
in the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswwswsw
in the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswsswswsw
illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
so fatal to beauty so killing to love,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswsws
once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswsswswsw
how many soft moments i spent in this grove,anapaestic,10,43,9,wsswswswsws
how fair was my nymph and how fervent my love,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
be still tho' my heart thine emotion give o'er,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
remember the season of love is no more,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsw
with her how i stray'd amid fountains and bow'rs,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
or loiter'd behind and collected the flow'rs,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
then breathless with ardor my fairone pursu'd,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswswssws
and to think with what kindness my garland she view'd,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswsswsw
but be still my fond heart this emotion give o'er,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
fain wouldst thou forget thou must love her no more,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw
ye belles and ye flirts and ye pert little things,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
who trip in this frolicksome round,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswwswsw
pray tell me from whence this indecency springs,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
the sexes at once to confound,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
what means the cock'd hat and the masculine air,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
with each motion design'd to perplex,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
bright eyes were intended to languish not stare,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
and softness the test of your sex,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
the girl who on beauty depends for support,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswwswswsws
may call ev'ry art to her aid,anapaestic,10,29,7,swswswsw
the bosom display'd and the petticoat short,anapaestic,10,43,7,wsswswwswsw
are samples she gives of her trade,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
but you on whom fortune indulgently smiles,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
and whom pride has preserv'd from the snare,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsw
should slily attack us with coyness and wiles,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswwswsw
not with open and insolent air,anapaestic,10,30,6,wwsswswsw
the venus whose statue delights all mankind,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
shrinks modestly back from the view,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
and kindly shou'd seem by the artist design'd,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
to serve as a model for you,anapaestic,10,27,7,wswwswsw
then learn with her beauties to copy her air,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
nor venture too much to reveal,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
our fancies will paint what you cover with care,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
and double each charm you conceal,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
the blushes of morn and the mildness of may,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
are charms which no art can procure,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
oh be but yourselves and our homage we pay,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
and your empire is solid and sure,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswswsw
but if amazon like you attack your gallants,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswswsw
and put us in fear of our lives,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswsws
you may do very well for sisters and aunts,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
but believe me you'll never be wives,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswwswsw
'midst beauty and pleasure's gay triumphs to languish,anapaestic,10,53,8,wswswswsswsw
and droop without knowing the source of my anguish,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswwsw
to start from short slumbers and look for the morning,anapaestic,10,53,10,swswswswswsw
yet close my dull eyes when i see it returning,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswssw
sighs sudden and frequent looks ever dejected,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswswsswsw
sounds that steal from my tongue by no meaning connected,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswswswswsw
ah say fellowswains how these symptoms befell me,anapaestic,10,48,8,swswswwswssw
they smile but reply not sure delia will tell me,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsws
thyrsis when we parted swore,trochaic,8,28,5,swswwsws
ere the spring he would return,trochaic,8,30,6,wswswsws
ah what means yon violet flower,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsswsw
and the buds that deck the thorn,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
'twas the lark that upward sprung,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
'twas the nightingale that sung,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
idle notes untimely green,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
why such unavailing haste,trochaic,8,25,4,wwswsws
western gales and skies serene,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
prove not always winter past,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
cease my doubts my fears to move,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsw
spare the honour of my love,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
leave me simple shepherd leave me,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
drag no more a hopeless chain,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
i cannot like nor would deceive thee,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswswsw
love the maid that loves again,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
tho' more gentle nymphs surround me,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
kindly pitying what i feel,trochaic,8,26,5,swswswsw
only you have power to wound me,trochaic,8,31,7,swswswsws
sylvia only you can heal,trochaic,8,24,5,wswswsws
corin cease this idle teazing,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
love that's forc'd is harsh and sour,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
if the lover be displeasing,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswswsw
to persist disgusts the more,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
'tis in vain in vain to fly me,trochaic,8,30,8,wswswsws
sylvia i will still pursue,trochaic,8,26,5,wswswsws
twenty thousand times deny me,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
i will kneel and weep anew,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
cupid ne'er shall make me languish,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsw
i was born averse to love,trochaic,8,25,6,wwswsws
lovers' sighs and tears and anguish,trochaic,8,35,6,swswswsw
mirth and pastime to me prove,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
still i vow with patient duty,trochaic,8,29,6,swswswsw
thus to meet your proudest scorn,trochaic,8,32,6,swswsws
you for unrelenting beauty,trochaic,8,26,4,wwswswsw
i for constant love was born,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
but the fates had not consented,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswswsw
since they both did fickle prove,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswsws
of her scorn the maid repented,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswswsw
and the shepherd of his love,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
'tis enough the hour is come,trochaic,8,28,6,swswswsw
now within the silent tomb,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
let this mortal frame decay,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
mingled with its kindred clay,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
since thy mercies oft of old,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
by thy chosen seers foretold,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
faithful now and stedfast prove,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
god of truth and god of love,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
since at length my aged eye,trochaic,8,27,6,wswsws
sees the dayspring from on high,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
son of righteousness to thee,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
lo the nations bow the knee,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
and the realms of distant kings,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
own the healing of thy wings,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
those whom death had overspread,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswsws
with his dark and dreary shade,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
lift their eyes and from afar,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
hail the light of jacob's star,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
waiting till the promis'd ray,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
turn their darkness into day,trochaic,8,28,5,wswswsw
see the beams intensely shed,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
shine o'er sion's favour'd head,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswsw
never may they hence remove,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
tho' the amorous beau,anapaestic,10,21,4,swswsw
so courtly and fine,anapaestic,10,19,4,wswsw
admire a dress,anapaestic,10,14,3,wsws
and face of fifteen,anapaestic,10,19,4,wswsw
let orinda but speak,anapaestic,10,20,4,swswsw
her tongue will surprize,anapaestic,10,24,4,swsws
and make him her slave,anapaestic,10,22,5,wswsw
spight of celia's bright eyes,anapaestic,10,29,5,swswsws
was she old and deform'd,anapaestic,10,24,5,wswsws
her wit and her air,anapaestic,10,19,5,wswsw
would conquer more hearts,anapaestic,10,25,4,wswsw
than the young and the fair,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswsws
those charms are more noble,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswwsw
the lovely and kind,anapaestic,10,19,4,wswsw
may vanquish the body,anapaestic,10,21,4,wswsws
she conquers the mind,anapaestic,10,21,4,wswsw
i am wearing away like the snow in the sun,anapaestic,10,42,10,wwsswswswsws
i am wearing away from the pain in my heart,anapaestic,10,43,10,wwsswswswsws
but ne'er shall he know who my peace has undone,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsws
how bitter how lasting how deep is my smart,anapaestic,10,43,9,wsswswswsws
i know he would pity so kind is his soul,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswwswswsws
to him my affliction would agony be,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswswsw
but never while i can my feelings control,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
the youth whom i love shall know sorrow through me,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
though longing to weep in his presence i'll smile,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
call the flush of my cheek the pure crimson of health,anapaestic,10,53,11,swswswswswsw
his fears for my peace by my song i'll beguile,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswwswswsws
nor venture to gaze on his eyes but by stealth,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
for conscious i am by my glance is exprest,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswwswsws
the passion that faithful as hopeless will be,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
and he whom alas i can ne'er render blest,anapaestic,10,41,9,wwswswswsws
shall never no never know sorrow through me,anapaestic,10,43,8,wsswsswswsw
to wander alone when the moon faintly beaming,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswsswswswsw
where owls seek for covert and night birds complaining,anapaestic,10,54,9,swswswswswsw
'tis not for the happy come daughter of sorrow,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswwswswswsw
where lost in the past nor regarding tomorrow,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsww
spring returns the flowrets blow,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
will hope return ah no ah no,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsws
with the dreams of youth she flies,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
and like the rose her emblem dies,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
fancy droops beneath the shade,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
and all the gay delights are fled,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
grief and mis'ry hence away,trochaic,8,27,5,wswswsw
this is nina's wedding day,trochaic,8,26,5,wwswsws
all her sorrows now are past,trochaic,8,28,6,wwswsws
may her joys for ever last,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
joy attend this happy pair,trochaic,8,26,5,swswsws
he is brave as she is fair,trochaic,8,26,7,wswswsw
guarded by the god of love,trochaic,8,26,6,swswsws
may they ever constant prove,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
how easy was colin how blithe and how gay,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
ere he met the fair chloris how sprightly his lay,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswsswsw
so graceful her form so accomplish'd her mind,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
sure pity he thought with such charms must be join'd,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsw
whenever she danc'd or whenever she sung,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
how just was her motion how sweet was her tongue,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
and when the youth told her his passionate flame,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
she allow'd him to fancy her heart felt the same,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswwswswsws
with ardour he press'd her to think him sincere,anapaestic,10,47,9,wsswswswsws
but alas she redoubled each hope and each fear,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswsswswsw
she would not deny nor she would not approve,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswsws
and she neither refus'd him nor gave him her love,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswwswsw
now cheer'd by complacence now froze by disdain,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswsws
he languish'd for freedom but languish'd in vain,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswswsw
'till thyrsis who pity'd so helpless a slave,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswsswswsw
eas'd his heart of its pain by the counsel he gave,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwswsw
forsake her said he and reject her awhile,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswwswsws
if she love you she soon will return with a smile,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
you can judge of her passion by absence alone,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswsswswsw
and by absence will conquer her heart or your own,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
this advice he pursu'd but the remedy prov'd,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswwswsw
too fatal alas to the fair one he lov'd,anapaestic,10,39,9,wsswswswsws
which cur'd his own passion but left her in vain,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
to sigh for a heart she could never regain,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswssws
quickly delia learn my passion,trochaic,8,30,5,swswswsw
lose not pleasure to be proud,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
courtship draws on observation,trochaic,8,30,4,swswswsw
and the whispers of the croud,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
soon or late you'll hear a lover,trochaic,8,32,7,swswswsw
nor by time his truth can prove,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
ages won't a heart discover,trochaic,8,27,5,swswswsw
trust and so secure my love,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
when the nymphs were contending for beauty and fame,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswsswsw
fair sylvia stood foremost in right of her claim,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsws
when to crown the high transports dear conquest excites,anapaestic,10,55,9,wwswswswswsw
at court she was envy'd and toasted at white's,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
but how shall i whisper this fair one's sad case,anapaestic,10,48,10,wwswswswsws
a cruel disease has spoil'd her sweet face,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswsws
her vermillion is chang'd to a dull settled red,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswssw
and all the gay graces of beauty are fled,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswsswswsw
yet take heed all ye fair how you triumph in vain,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswwswsw
for sylvia tho' alter'd from pretty to plain,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswwsw
is now more engaging fince reason took place,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswsswswsw
than when she possess'd the perfections of face,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswswsw
convinc'd she no more can coquet it and teaze,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswwswsws
instead of tormenting she studies to please,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
makes truth and discretion the guide of her life,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsw
and tho' spoil'd for a toast she's well form'd for a wife,anapaestic,10,57,12,wswswswswsws
he's gone the bright way that his honour directs him,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswsswsw
oh all ye kind powers let me beg you protect him,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswssw
he's gone my dear and left me here mourning,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswsw
but hang these dull thoughts i'le fancy him returning,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswswswswsw
returning i'le think the great hero victorious,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswsswswsswsw
with joy to my arms as faithful as glorious,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswwswswswsw
against his bright eyes i am sure there's no standing,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswswssw
he looks like a god and moves as commanding,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
with a face so angelick the foe will be charmed,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
the conquest were his tho he met'em disarm'd,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswssws
they could not be sure of a rational nature,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswsswsw
that wou'd not relent at so moving a feature,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswssw
venus disguis'd he'el be thought by his beauty,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswwsw
and spar'd from the sense of a generous duty,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswsswsw
yet when i reflect on the wounded and dying,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
in spight of my courage it sets me a sighing,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswswsw
but the resolute brave no danger can stay him,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswswsw
tho' i us'd all my charms and arts to delay him,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswssw
yet oh ye kind powers you are bound to protect him,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswssw
since he'es gone the bright way that glory directs him,anapaestic,10,54,10,swswswswswsws
ye scenes that engag'd my gay youth,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
say whither so fast do ye fly,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
if the lesson you told me was truth,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
ah why do ye fade from my eye,anapaestic,10,29,8,wswswsws
that meadow where often i stray'd,anapaestic,10,33,6,wsswswsw
that bank and yon shadowy tree,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsw
those streams with such fondness survey'd,anapaestic,10,41,6,wswwswsw
have hid all their sweetness from me,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswwswsw
yon hill that uprears his smooth head,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsw
where the wildthyme its fragrance bestows,anapaestic,10,41,6,swswswsws
whose verdures have rose from my bed,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
and whose breezes have sigh'd my repose,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
what tho' from his summit so high,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswwswsw
flock cottage and woodland are seen,anapaestic,10,35,6,wsswswsw
yet no more i with fondness descry,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
for indifference rises between,anapaestic,10,30,4,swsswssws
ah whither ye sweets do ye fly,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
for fancy your absence must mourn,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
ah say will ye fade from my eye,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswsws
and yet will ye never return,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswwssws
that valley whose mantle so gay,anapaestic,10,31,6,wsswswsw
is with primrose and cowslip o'erspread,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswsw
no longer invites me to stray,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
and rifle the sweets of their bed,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
not odious at present they look,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswswsw
i discern that their colours are bright,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
but their charms have my fancy forsook,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
and their fragrance forgot to delight,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswsws
to my cooler attention how dear,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswsws
the soothing complaint of the dove,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
i have left my companions to hear,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
the woodlinnet warble her love,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
nor these can my footsteps retard,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswsws
or if round me they carelessly fly,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
from mine eyes they attract no regard,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
and my ears their soft warblings deny,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
ah sure 'tis the bus'ness of life,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
that bids those endearments depart,anapaestic,10,34,5,swswswsws
to involve us in cares and in strife,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
that estrange and entangle the heart,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
with destiny all must comply,anapaestic,10,28,5,wswswsws
yet cannot my fancy but mourn,anapaestic,10,29,6,wsswswsw
for the season that fades from my eye,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
and the sweets that must never return,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswssws
now evening had tinged the gay landskip with gold,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
the swains were retired and their flocks in the fold,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswwswsw
when delia complain'd in the woodland alone,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswswsw
loud ecchoes retain'd and replied to her moan,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
the warblers sat listening around on the spray,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswwswswsw
and the gale stole in murmurs as soft as her lay,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsws
ah my strephon twas thus the fair mourner begun,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwswswswswsw
how cruel to leave me thus lost and undone,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswsws
your vows like the wind you forget or despise,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
you slight my complaints and are deaf to my cries,anapaestic,10,49,10,swswswwswsw
the frown once so dreadful ah where is its power,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
the voice heard with transport gives transport no more,anapaestic,10,54,9,wswswswswsw
though the sylvans to please me exert all their powers,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswsw
though the swains crown my head with a garland of flowers,anapaestic,10,57,11,wswswswwswsw
though they swear that my eyes like the morning are gay,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswswwswsw
that my song is more sweet than the nightingales lay,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswwswsw
yet while strephon is absent dejected dismay'd,anapaestic,10,46,7,wwsswswswsws
i droop like a flower that repines in the shade,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
o return gentle shepherd return to my prayer,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswsswswsw
ah think how i sigh in unpitied despair,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswssws
but in vain all my hopes all my wishes are vain,anapaestic,10,47,11,wwswswswswsw
while the streams and the breezes thus hear me complain,anapaestic,10,55,10,wwswwswswsws
while the birds to my anguish reply from the bough,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswsswsw
he flies from my arms and regards not my woe,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
ah too easy to trust all the oaths that he swore,anapaestic,10,48,11,swswswswswsw
when he vow'd that no nymph had e'er charm'd him before,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswswswsws
be warn'd then ye fair nor too rashly believe,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
think the men when they flatter but want to deceive,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsws
that the fond easy promise was ne'er meant to bind,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswsswswsw
and believe when they swear that their oaths are all wind,anapaestic,10,57,11,swswwswwswsw
shall pope sing his flames,anapaestic,10,26,5,wswsw
with quality dames,anapaestic,10,18,3,wswsw
and dutchesses toast when he dines,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
shall swift ballads compose,anapaestic,10,27,4,swssws
on the girls at the rose,anapaestic,10,24,6,wswsws
whilst unsung is my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswsws
o were phoebus my friend,anapaestic,10,24,5,wwswsw
or would bacchus but lend,anapaestic,10,25,5,wwswsw
me the spirits that flow from his wines,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
the lass of the mill,anapaestic,10,20,5,wswsw
molly mogg and lepell,anapaestic,10,21,4,swswsw
shou'd be dowdies to fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswswsws
the astronomer cries,anapaestic,10,20,3,swswsw
look up to yon skies,anapaestic,10,20,5,wswsw
and view the bright heavenly signs,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsw
for a sight brighter far,anapaestic,10,24,5,wswsws
than sun moon or star,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsw
let him look at my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
the miser for gain,anapaestic,10,18,4,wswsw
thinks nothing of pain,anapaestic,10,22,4,wswsw
and contentedly digs in the mines,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
let him take all peru,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsws
and rich mexico too,anapaestic,10,19,4,swswsw
what are these to my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
any porter may serve,anapaestic,10,20,4,swswsw
for a copy to carve,anapaestic,10,19,5,wwswsw
an alcides with muscular chines,anapaestic,10,31,5,wswswsws
but a venus to draw,anapaestic,10,19,5,wwswsw
bright as eye ever saw,anapaestic,10,22,5,wswsws
he must copy my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
the favourite child,anapaestic,10,19,3,wswsw
whom her fondness has spoil'd,anapaestic,10,29,5,wwswsw
for mamma often whimpers and whines,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswswsw
and this hour let me die,anapaestic,10,24,6,wwswsws
but i languish and sigh,anapaestic,10,23,5,wwswsw
when i'm absent from fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswswsws
for quadrille when the fair,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswsws
cards and counters prepare,anapaestic,10,26,4,wswsws
they cast out the tens eights and nines,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswsws
and in love 'tis my fear,anapaestic,10,24,6,wswsws
the like fate i shall share,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswsws
discarded by fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,33,5,wswswsws
astrologers prove,anapaestic,10,17,2,wswsw
the conjunctions above,anapaestic,10,22,3,wswsws
with their houses squares circles and signs,anapaestic,10,43,7,wwsswswsw
but oh could they show,anapaestic,10,22,5,wswsw
one conjunction below,anapaestic,10,21,3,wswsws
between me and my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswwswsws
with hearts full of rapture,anapaestic,10,27,5,swswsw
our good dean and chapter,anapaestic,10,25,5,swswsw
count over and finger their fines,anapaestic,10,33,6,wsswswsw
but i'd give their estate,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswsws
was it ten times as great,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswsws
for one kiss from my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
in the midst of gay sights,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswsws
and foreign delights,anapaestic,10,20,3,wswsw
for his country the banish'd man pines,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
thus from her when away,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsws
tho' my eyes they may stray,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswsws
yet my heart is with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
antiquity's page,anapaestic,10,16,2,wswsw
the rev'rend sage,anapaestic,10,17,3,swsw
explains from old medals and coins,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswsws
but no comment so fit,anapaestic,10,21,5,swswsw
on youth beauty and wit,anapaestic,10,23,5,swswsw
can they find as my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
it is atropos' sport,anapaestic,10,20,4,wwswsw
with her sheers to cut short,anapaestic,10,28,6,wwswsws
the thread which dame lachesis twines,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswswsws
but forbear you curst jade,anapaestic,10,26,5,wswsws
or cut mine not the thread,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswsws
that was spun for my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
the young pair for a crown,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswsws
on his book paid him down,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswsws
the sacrist obsequiously joins,anapaestic,10,30,4,wsswswsws
was i bishop i swear,anapaestic,10,20,5,wwswsw
i'd resign him my chair,anapaestic,10,23,5,swswsw
to unite me with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
for my first night i'd go,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswsws
to those regions of snow,anapaestic,10,24,5,wwswsw
where the sun for six months never shines,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
and oh there shou'd complain,anapaestic,10,28,5,wswsws
he too soon came again,anapaestic,10,22,5,wswsws
to disturb me with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
the pastures the sheep,anapaestic,10,22,4,wswsw
shall exchange for the deep,anapaestic,10,27,5,swswsw
and mackrel shall grow on the vines,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
the sun shall burn blue,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsw
ere my heart proves untrue,anapaestic,10,26,5,wswsws
or forgets to love fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
how pleasant is love,anapaestic,10,20,4,wswsw
when forbid or unknown,anapaestic,10,22,4,wswsws
was my passion approv'd,anapaestic,10,23,4,wwssws
it would quickly be gone,anapaestic,10,24,5,wwswsw
it adds to the charms,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsw
when we steal the delight,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswsws
why should love be expos'd,anapaestic,10,26,5,wwswsw
since himself has no sight,anapaestic,10,26,5,swswsw
in some silvan shade,anapaestic,10,20,4,wwsws
let me sigh for my swain,anapaestic,10,24,6,wswsws
where none but an eccho,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswwsw
will speak on't again,anapaestic,10,21,4,swsws
thus silent and soft,anapaestic,10,20,4,wswsw
i'll pass the time on,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsw
and when i grow weary,anapaestic,10,21,5,wwswsw
i'll make my love known,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsw
when approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of spring,anapaestic,10,50,9,swswswswswsw
swelling buds open first and look gay,anapaestic,10,37,7,sswswswsw
when the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing,anapaestic,10,56,12,wswswswwswsw
and are danc'd by the breeze on each spray,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswsws
when gently descending the rain in soft showers,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswsswswswsw
with its moisture refreshes the ground,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
and the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers,anapaestic,10,56,12,wswswswwswwsw
like rich gems beam a lustre around,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswssws
when the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
and the cuckow proclaims with his voice,anapaestic,10,39,7,wwsswswsw
that nature marks this for the season to wooe,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
and for all that can love to rejoice,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
in a cottage at night may i spend all my time,anapaestic,10,45,11,wwswswswswsw
in the fields and the meadows all day,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
with a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
young as april and blooming as may,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
when the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn,anapaestic,10,55,11,wwswswswswsw
may my fairest and i sweetly wake,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
view the far distant hills which the sun beams adorn,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsws
then arise and our cottage forsake,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswwssws
when the sun shines so warm that my charmer and i,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswwswsw
may recline on the turf without fear,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswwswswssws
while we breathe the first sweets of the year,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswsws
be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
bubble out and transparently flow,anapaestic,10,33,5,sswswswsw
creep gently along in meanders and glide,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswssws
while the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswswsw
and the violets their sweetness impart,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswswsw
let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
the rich cordial that thrills to the heart,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswsws
while the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsws
which the fowler has caught in his snares,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
may we think ourselves blest that it is not our fate,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
to endure such an absence as theirs,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
may i listen to all her soft tender sweet notes,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
when she sings and no sounds interfere,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
but the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats,anapaestic,10,59,10,wwswswswwswsw
are at strife to be louder than her,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
when the daisies and cowslips and primroses blow,anapaestic,10,48,8,wwsswswswsws
and checquer the meads and the lawns,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
may we see bounding there the swift lightfooted doe,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswsswsw
and pursue with our eye the young fawns,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
when the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run,anapaestic,10,59,11,wwswswswswsw
and the sirstlings are all at their play,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
and the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
let us then be as frolic as they,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
when i talk of my love should i chance to espy,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswwswsw
that she seems to mistrust what i say,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
by a tear that is ready to fall from her eye,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswswsswswsw
with my lips let me wipe it away,anapaestic,10,32,8,swswswsws
if we sit or we walk may i cast round my eyes,anapaestic,10,45,12,wswswswwswsw
and let no single beauty escape,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswswsw
but see none to create so much love and surprize,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsws
as her eyes and her face and her shape,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves,anapaestic,10,54,12,wswswswwswsw
and the meadows around us are mown,anapaestic,10,34,7,wwsswswsw
when the lass on the sweetsmelling haycock receives,anapaestic,10,51,8,wswswswwssws
what she afterwards blushes to own,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
when evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswswsswsw
with the dew then no longer we'll roam,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
with my arm round her waist in a path thro' the meads,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
let us hasten to find our way home,anapaestic,10,34,8,swswswsws
when the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings,anapaestic,10,59,12,wswswswwswsw
each one by the side of its mate,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
when a mist that arises a drowsiness brings,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswsswswsw
upon all but the owl and the bat,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
when soft rest is requir'd and the stars lend their light,anapaestic,10,57,11,wswswswwswsw
and all nature lies quiet and still,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwsswswsw
when no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswsswswsw
but at distance the clack of a mill,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
with peace for our pillow and free from all noise,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
so that voices in whispers are known,anapaestic,10,36,7,wwsswswsw
let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwswsw
that are mus'd on by lovers alone,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswssws
fairy minstrels haste away,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
here attune the pensive lay,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
where these roses crown the sod,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
avonia's bard awaits his god,trochaic,8,28,5,wsswswsws
though avon's stream for ever flow,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
so sweet a bard it ne'er shall know,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
child of nature void of art,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
how he knew the human heart,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
when the magic shell he strung,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
echo glad responsive sung,trochaic,8,25,4,swswsws
whilst the cowslip's fairy train,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
lightly trod the daisy'd plain,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
and still at fall of dewy night,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
by the moon's uncertain light,trochaic,8,29,5,wwswsws
whilst they move to airs divine,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
round his tomb they sweetly twine,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
where the light cannot pierce in a grove of all trees,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswwswsw
with my fair one as blooming as may,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswwswwswsw
let me pass the hot noon of the day,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
when the sun less intense to the westward inclines,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswwswsw
for the meadows the groves we'll forsake,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswsws
and see the rays dance as inverted he shines,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
on the face of some river or lake,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswswsw
where my fairest and i on its verge as we pass,anapaestic,10,46,11,wwswswswswsw
for 'tis she that must still be my theme,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
our two shadows may view on the watery glass,anapaestic,10,44,9,swsswswwswsw
while the fish are at play in the stream,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
may the herds cease to lowe and the lambkins to bleat,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswwswsw
when she sings me some amorous strain,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsw
all be silent and husht unless echo repeat,anapaestic,10,42,8,wwswswswssws
the kind words and sweet sounds back again,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswsws
and when we return to our cottage at night,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswwswsw
hand in hand as we sauntering stray,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswswsws
just direct us and chequer our way,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswwswsw
let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk,anapaestic,10,48,9,swsswswswsws
as thus gently and slowly we move,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
and let no single thought be express'd in our talk,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswsswsw
but of friendship improv'd into love,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
thus enchanted each day with these rural delights,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswswswssws
and secure from ambition's alarms,anapaestic,10,33,5,swswswsws
soft love and repose shall divide all our nights,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
and each morning shall rise with new charms,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswsws
by a prattling stream on a midsummer's eve,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswwswsw
where the woodbine and jess'mine their boughs interweave,anapaestic,10,56,8,wwswswwswsws
fair flora i cry'd to my arbour repair,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsw
for i must have a chaplet for sweet william's hair,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswwswswsws
she brought me the vi'let that grows on the hill,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
the vale dwelling lilly and gilded jonquill,anapaestic,10,43,7,swswsswswsw
but such languid odours how cou'd i approve,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswsws
just warm from the lips of the lad that i love,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
she brought me his faith and his truth to display,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswsws
the undying myrtle and evergreen bay,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswswwsw
but why these to me who've his constancy known,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
and billy has laurels enough of his own,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
the next was a gift that i could not contemn,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
for she brought me two roses that grew on a stem,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswsswswsw
of the dear nuptial tie they stood emblems confest,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsws
so i kiss'd 'em and press'd 'em quite close to my breast,anapaestic,10,56,12,wwswswswswsw
she brought me a sunflow'r this fair one's your due,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswwswswswsw
for it once was a maiden and lovesick like you,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswsswswsw
oh give it me quick to my shepherd i'll run,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
as true to his flame as this flow'r to the sun,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswsswsw
dame venus a daughter of jove's,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
and amongst all his daughters most fair,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
lost it seems t' other day the two doves,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswswsw
that wafted her car thro' the air,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
the dame made a heavy sad rout,anapaestic,10,30,7,swswswsw
ran about heav'n and earth to condole 'em,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswswsw
and sought high and low to find out,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
where the biddyes were stray'd or who stole 'em,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswsw
to the god who the stragglers shou'd meet,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswsw
she promis'd most tempting fine pay,anapaestic,10,35,6,wsswswsw
six kisses than honey more sweet,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
and a seventh far sweeter than they,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwsswswsw
the proposal no sooner was made,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswsws
but it put all the gods in a flame,anapaestic,10,34,9,swswswsws
for who would not give all he had,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
to be kiss'd by so dainty a dame,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
to cyprus to paphos they run,anapaestic,10,28,6,wsswswsw
where the goddess oft us'd to retire,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
some rode round the world with the sun,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
and search'd every country and shire,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
but with all their hard running and riding,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswsws
not a god of 'em claim'd the reward,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
for no one could tell tale or tiding,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
if the doves were alive or were starv'd,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
at last the sly shooter of men,anapaestic,10,30,7,swswswsw
young cupid i beg the god's pardon,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
mamma your blue birds i have seen,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
in a certain terrestrial garden,anapaestic,10,31,5,swswswswsw
where where my dear child quickly shew,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
quoth the dame almost out of her wits,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
do but go to chlorinda's says cu,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
and you'll find 'em in shape of pewits,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
is it she that hath done me this wrong,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
full well i know her and her arts,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
she has follow'd the thieving trade long,anapaestic,10,40,7,wwsswswsw
but i thought she dealt only in hearts,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
i shall soon make her know so i shall,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
and with that to jove's palace she run,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
and began like a bedlam to bawl,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsws
i am cheated i'm robb'd i'm undone,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
chlorinda whom none can approach,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
without losing his heart or his senses,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswswsw
has stol'n the two doves from my coach,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
and now flaunts it at venus' expences,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsws
she has chang'd the poor things to pewits,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswsw
and keeps 'em like ord'nary fowls,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
so when she robs men of their wits,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
she turns 'em to asses or owls,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
i cou'd tell you of many a hundred,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsws
of figure high station and means,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
whom she without mercy has plunder'd,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswswsw
ever since she came into her teens,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
but her thefts upon earth i'd have borne,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
or have let 'em all pass for mere fable,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswswsw
but nothing will now serve her turn,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
but the doves out of venus's stable,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsws
is it fit let your mighty ship say,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
that i like some pitiful flirt,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswwswsw
shou'd tarry within doors all day,anapaestic,10,33,6,wsswswsw
or else trudge it afoot in the dirt,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
is it fit that a mortal shou'd trample,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsws
on me who am styl'd queen of beauty,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
o make her great jove an example,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
and teach nimblefingers her duty,anapaestic,10,32,5,swswswsws
sir jove when he heard her thus rage,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
for all his great gravity smil'd,anapaestic,10,32,6,wwswswsw
and then like a judge wise and sage,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
he began in terms sober and mild,anapaestic,10,32,7,swswswsws
learn daughter to bridle your tongue,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswsws
forbear to traduce with your prattle,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswswsw
the fair who has done you no wrong,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
and scorns to purloin goods and chattel,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
she needs neither gewgaw nor trinket,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
to carry the world all before her,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
her deserts i wou'd have you to think it,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswsws
are enough to make all men adore her,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswswsw
your doves are elop'd i confess,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
and chuse with chlorinda to dwell,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsw
but blame not the lady for this,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswwswsw
for sure 'tis no crime to excel,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
as for them i applaud their high aims,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
having serv'd from the time of their birth,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswsws
the fairest of heavenly dames,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswswsw
they would now serve the fairest on earth,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswsw
though bacchus may boast of his carekilling bowl,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswswswsw
such worship alas has no charms for the soul,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
to the arrow of fate or the canker of care,anapaestic,10,42,10,wwswswswswsw
but to fancy that feeds on the charms of the fair,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
what soul that's possess'd of a dream so divine,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswsws
for the tear that bedews sensibility's shrine,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswsswswsw
the tender excess which enamours the heart,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
of those exquisite feelings that please tho' we smart,anapaestic,10,53,9,wwswswswswsw
each change and excess have thro' life been my doom,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw
the bottle affords us a glimpse through the gloom,anapaestic,10,49,9,wsswswswsws
come then rosy venus and spread o'er my sight,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswsws
awake in my breast the soft dream of delight,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswsws
then deep will i drink of the nectar divine,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
each throb of my heart shall accord with the wine,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
and now my gay comrades the myrtle and vine,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
let reason not riot the garland entwine,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
fairest flow'r all flow'rs excelling,trochaic,8,36,5,swswswsws
which in eden's garden grew,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswsws
flow'rs of eve's' imbower'd dwellinga,trochaic,8,37,5,swswswsws

i hope sir by this you have found your account,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswwswsws
in visiting airy and seeing his mount,anapaestic,10,37,7,wsswswswsws
if froth can delight you you're wonderous happy,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswwswsww
and we know it gives joy on a bottle of nappy,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswwsswsw
your friend would be very much mended in troth,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswsswswsw
should airy bestow him a dash of his froth,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswsws
to keep up the metaphor 'twould make him mellow,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswwsswswswsw
and of a sour stoic a pleasant young fellow,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswsswsswsw
and airy be recompens'd well for that favour,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswwsw
if your friend in return should make him grow graver,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsww
this exchange should they make it would set 'em both right,anapaestic,10,58,11,swswwswwswsw
since one is too solid and t'other too light,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw
prythee why so fantastick and vain,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
what charms can the toilet supply,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwssws
why so studious admirers to gain,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswswsw
need beauty lay traps for the eye,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
because that thy breast is so fair,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
must thy tucker be still setting right,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
and canst thou not laughing forbear,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswwswsw
because that thy teeth are so white,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
shall sovereign beauty descend,anapaestic,10,30,4,wswswsw
to act so ignoble a part,anapaestic,10,24,6,swswswsw
whole hours at the lookingglass spend,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswswswsw
a slave to the dictates of art,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
and cannot thy heart be at rest,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
unless thou excellest each fair,anapaestic,10,31,5,wswswsws
in trinkets and trumpery dress'd,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
is not that a superfluous care,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswswsw
vain idle attempt to pretend,anapaestic,10,28,5,wswswsws
the lilly with whiteness to deck,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
does the rich solitaire recommend,anapaestic,10,33,5,wswswswws
the delicate turn of thy neck,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
the glossy bright hue of thy hair,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
can powder or jewels adorn,anapaestic,10,26,5,wsswsws
can perfumes or vermilions compare,anapaestic,10,34,5,wswswswsws
with the breath or the blush of the morn,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
when embarrass'd with baubles and toys,anapaestic,10,38,6,swswswsws
thou'rt set out so enormously fine,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswswsw
overdoing thy purpose destroys,anapaestic,10,30,4,swswswsws
and to please thou hast too much design,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
little know'st thou how beauty beguiles,anapaestic,10,39,6,swswswsws
how alluring the innocent eye,anapaestic,10,29,5,swsswswsw
what sweetness in natural smiles,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
and what charms in simplicity lye,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswswsw
thee nature with beauty has clad,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
with genuine ornaments dress'd,anapaestic,10,30,4,wsswswsw
nor can art an embellishment add,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswswsw
to set off what already is best,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswswsw
be it thine selfaccomplish'd to reign,anapaestic,10,37,6,wswswswsw
bid the toilet be far set apart,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsws
and dismiss with an honest disdain,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswwssws
that impertinent abigail art,anapaestic,10,28,4,wswswswsw
say sad tenant of the grove,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
whence the pains that now you prove,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsw
why within your throbbing breast,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
why is sorrow still a guest,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswsws
sleeps in death your murder'd mate,trochaic,8,34,6,swswsws
weep'st thou his melancholy fate,trochaic,8,32,5,wswswsws
if 'tis that disturbs thy peace,trochaic,8,31,6,swswsws
spring shall bid thy sorrows cease,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
then thy breast that heaves in woe,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsw
with love's bright flame again shall glow,trochaic,8,41,7,wswswsws
yet sweet mourner still complain,trochaic,8,32,5,swswsws
nor though bless'd forbear thy strain,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsw
for sweetly sad thy warblings flow,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
and charming is thy song of woe,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
as at eve he treads the plain,trochaic,8,29,7,wswswsw
oft it soothes the shepherd swain,trochaic,8,33,6,swswsws
when he seeks the conscious shade,trochaic,8,33,6,wwswsws
there to meet the village maid,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
he with rapture hears thy lay,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
issue from the hawthorn spray,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
and with mine unites his praise,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
of philomela's tender lays,trochaic,8,26,4,wswswsws
the minutes the hours the days and the years,anapaestic,10,44,9,wsswswswsws
that fill up the current of time,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswwswsw
neither flowing with hopes neither ebbing with fears,anapaestic,10,52,8,swswswswswsw
unheeded roll'd on to my prime,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
in infancy prattling in youth full of play,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswswsw
still pleas'd with whatever was new,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswsswsw
i bad the old cripple fly swifter away,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswsswswsw
to o'ertake some gay trifle in view,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
but when chloe with sweetness and sense in her look,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwsswswswsws
first taught me the lesson of love,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
then i counted each step the wing'd fugitive took,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
and bad him more leisurely move,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
stop runaway stop nor thy journey pursue,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
for chloe has gi'en me her heart,anapaestic,10,32,7,wsswswsws
to enjoy it thy years will prove many too few,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswswswsw
if you make so much haste to depart,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswsws
still still he flies on still still let him fly,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswsws
'till he's tired and panting for breath,anapaestic,10,39,7,wwsswswsw
my love both his teeth and his scythe shall defy,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
that can only be conquer'd by death,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
happy verses that were prest,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
in fair ethelinda's breast,trochaic,8,26,4,swswsws
happy muse that didst embrace,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
the sweet the heav'nlyfragrant place,trochaic,8,36,5,wswswsws
tell me is the omen true,trochaic,8,24,6,wswwsws
shall the bard arrive there too,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswsws
oft thro' my eyes my soul has flown,trochaic,8,35,8,wswswsws
and wanton'd on that ivory throne,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswswsw
there with extatic transport burn'd,trochaic,8,35,5,wswsswsw
and thought it was to heav'n return'd,trochaic,8,37,7,wswswsws
shall the body follow too,trochaic,8,25,5,wwswsws
when first at nature's early birth,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
heav'n sent a man upon the earth,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
ev'n eden was more fruitful found,trochaic,8,33,6,wswswsws
when adam came to till the ground,trochaic,8,33,7,wswswsws
shall then those breasts be fair in vain,trochaic,8,40,8,wswswsws
and only rise to fall again,trochaic,8,27,6,wswswsws
no no fair nymph for no such end,trochaic,8,32,8,wswswsws
did heav'n to thee its bounty lend,trochaic,8,34,7,wswswsws
that breast was ne'er design'd by fate,trochaic,8,38,7,wswswsws
for verse or things inanimate,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws
then throw them from that downy bed,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsws
and take the poet in their stead,trochaic,8,32,7,wswswsws
how i hail this morn's appearing,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswswsw
safety danger past endearing,trochaic,8,28,4,swswswsw
fame is thine lo crowds aver it,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsws
but i charge thee don't prefer it,trochaic,8,33,7,wwswswsw
thou thy country's call obeying,trochaic,8,31,5,wwswswsw
and thy ready zeal repaying,trochaic,8,27,5,wwswswsw
but have i no claims my rover,trochaic,8,29,7,wwswswsw
yes o yes and wandering over,trochaic,8,28,6,swswswsws
ha methinks thy glances reading,trochaic,8,31,5,wswswswsw
duty still love's claim impeding,trochaic,8,32,5,swswswsw
of my fears too dread revival,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswswsw
yet with tearful joy i see,trochaic,8,26,6,wwswsws
potent over love and me,trochaic,8,23,5,swswsws
hy would you know the passion,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsw
you have kindled in my breast,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
trifling is the inclination,trochaic,8,27,4,swswswsw
that by words can be express'd,trochaic,8,30,6,wwswsws
in my silence see the lover,trochaic,8,27,6,wwswswsw
true love is by silence known,trochaic,8,29,6,wswwsws
in my eyes you'll best discover,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswswsw
all the power of your own,trochaic,8,25,6,wswsws
love's gay queen who reigns on earth,trochaic,8,36,7,wswswsw
smil'd miranda at thy birth,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
pleas'd she bid thy angel face,trochaic,8,30,6,swswsws
beam with each bewitching grace,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
round your waist her zone she threw,trochaic,8,35,7,wswswsw
charms divine thus giving you,trochaic,8,29,5,swswsws
cupid knelt and lowting low,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
to your sway resign'd his bow,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswsws
jove who saw the temple fair,trochaic,8,28,6,swswsws
thron'd each human virtue there,trochaic,8,31,5,swswsws
pallas then the work to crown,trochaic,8,29,6,swswsws
made her aegis all your own,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
apollo of old on britannia did smile,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsswsw
and delphi forsook for the sake of this isle,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
around him he lavishly scatter'd his lays,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswswsw
and in every wilderness planted his bays,anapaestic,10,40,7,wwswswswswsw
then chaucer and spenser harmonious were heard,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswsswsw
then shakespear and milton and waller appear'd,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswswsws
and dryden whose brows by apollo were crown'd,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
as he sung in such strains as the god might have own'd,anapaestic,10,54,12,wswswswwswsw
but now since the laurel is given of late,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
to cibber to eusden to shadwell and tate,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
apollo hath quitted the isle he once lov'd,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswswswsws
and his harp and his bays to hibernia remov'd,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswwswsswsws
he vows and he swears he'll inspire us no more,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
and has put out pope's fires which he kindled before,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswwswsw
and further he says men no longer shall boast,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
a science their slight and ill treatment hath lost,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
but that women alone for the future shall write,anapaestic,10,47,9,swsswswwswsw
and who can resist when they doubly delight,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswssws
and lest we shou'd doubt what he said to be true,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
has begun by inspiring saphira and you,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsswswsw
tho' the plumb and the peach with apollo conspire,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswsswsw
to present you their softness and sweetness and fire,anapaestic,10,52,9,wsswwswswswsw
their aid is in vain for what can they do,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswswsws
but blush and confess them selves vanquish'd by you,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsw
where virtue and wit with such qualities blend,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsw
what mortal what goddess would dare to contend,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswwswsws
can ease be consistent with state,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsw
can freedom and pomp thus agree,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
o stanhope who wou'd not be great,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
if easy in greatness like thee,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
let statesmen pretend to despise,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
those talents that furnish delight,anapaestic,10,34,5,wswswsws
'tis stanhope's alone to be wise,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
yet pleasure with wisdom unite,anapaestic,10,30,5,wsswswsw
state burthens with form the gay soul,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
unbended alone we taste joy,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswswsws
too soon our grey hairs must controul,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsw
that bliss which our prime should employ,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswsws
then stanhope be blest in your choice,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
be happy your life in each stage,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
while spirits attend you rejoice,anapaestic,10,32,5,wswswsws
you've wisdom enough for old age,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
that your honour's petitioners dealers in rhyme,anapaestic,10,47,7,swsswsswswsw
and writers of scandal for mending the times,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
by losses in bus'ness and england's welldoing,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswwsswswsws
are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswwswswswsw
that these their misfortunes they humbly conceive,anapaestic,10,49,7,wwswswswsws
arise not from dulness as some folks believe,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswwswswsws
but from rubs in their way that your honour has laid,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
and want of materials to carry on trade,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswsswswsw
that they always had form'd high conceits of their use,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswsw
and meant their last breath should go out in abuse,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsw
but now and they speak it with sorrow and tears,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
since your honour has sate at the helm of affairs,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwsswswswsws
no party will join 'em no faction invite,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
to heed what they say or to read what they write,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
sedition and tumult and discord are fled,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
and slander scarce ventures to lift up her head,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
in short publick bus'ness is so carry'd on,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswswssw
that their country is sav'd and the patriots undone,anapaestic,10,51,9,wwswswswssws
to perplex 'em still more and sure famine to bring,anapaestic,10,50,10,swswswswswsw
now satire has lost both its truth and its sting,anapaestic,10,48,10,wsswswswswsw
if in spite of their natures they bungle at praise,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswsswswsw
your honour regards not and nobody pays,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
your petitioners therefore most humbly entreat,anapaestic,10,46,6,swsswswswsws
as times will allow and your honour thinks meet,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswwswsw
that measures be chang'd and some cause of complaint,anapaestic,10,52,9,wsswswswsws
be immediately furnish'd to end their restraint,anapaestic,10,47,7,swswswswswsws
their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve,anapaestic,10,48,8,wsswswswsws
that again they may rail and the nation believe,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswwswwssws
or else if your wisdom shall deem it all one,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
now the parliament's rising and bus'ness is done,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswsswswsw
that your honour would please at this dangerous crisis,anapaestic,10,54,9,wwswswswswsw
to take to your bosom a few private vices,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswwswswswsw
by which your petitioners haply might thrive,anapaestic,10,44,7,swswsswswsw
and keep both themselves and contention alive,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswswswsw
in compassion good sir give 'em something to say,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswswswsw
and your honour's petitioners ever shall pray,anapaestic,10,45,7,swsswsswswsw
tho' the muse had deny'd me so often before,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswwswsw
i ventur'd this day to invoke her once more,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
she ask'd what i wanted i said with delight,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswwswswsws
your lordship had promis'd to sup here tonight,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswwswsws
that on an occasion so much to my honour,anapaestic,10,40,9,wwswswswswsw
i hop'd she'd excuse me for calling upon her,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswwswssw
to this she reply'd with disdain in her looks,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
if that be the case go summon your cooks,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswswsw
i told her in answer how little you eat,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswswswswsw
that in vain i should hope to regale you with meat,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswswswsw
that she knew wit and humour to you were a feast,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswwsw
who had tho' no stomach an excellent taste,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswsswswsw
this calm'd her resentment she paus'd for a while,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
then the goddess propitious reply'd with a smile,anapaestic,10,48,8,swsswsswswsw
if with humour and wit you would have him delighted,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwswswswwswsw
what need i be call'd let the dean be invited,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswwswswswsw
the bus'ness is done if with him you prevail,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswwsws
for a boyle and a swift will each other regale,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswssws
to the late king of britain a savage was brought,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswsswswsw
which wild in the woods of germania was caught,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswsswsw
this present so princely was train'd up with care,anapaestic,10,49,9,wsswswswsws
and knew how to eat and to jump and to stare,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswswswswsw
the beaux and the belles beheld it with joy,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswsw
and at court the high mode was to see the wild boy,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
reflecting on this with a politic view,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswsw
i determin'd to send such a present to you,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswswssww
in the wilds of hibernia this boy was beset,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswsswswsws
and caught as the natives are there in a net,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
the creature has sense and in my eyes is pretty,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswwswsw
with talents to make a good man in the city,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswwsw
industrious and orderly prudent and smart,anapaestic,10,41,6,wswswswsswsw
and not too much conscience nor too little art,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswsws
not scrup'lous but honest a heart set on gain,anapaestic,10,45,9,wsswswswsws
whose highest ambition is fix'd on the chain,anapaestic,10,44,8,wsswswswsws
from you may he copy to wear it with glory,anapaestic,10,42,10,wwswswswswsw
like you in return be honour'd in story,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsswsw
i blame all the fears i gave way to before,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswwswswsws
i say to my heart be at rest and believe,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswwswswsws
that whom once she has chosen she never will leave,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswsswswsw
but ah when i think on each ravishing grace,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
that plays in the smiles of that heavenly face,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
my heart beats again i again apprehend,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswswws
some fortunate rival in every friend,anapaestic,10,36,6,wswswswswsw
these painful suspicions you cannot remove,anapaestic,10,42,6,wswswswssws
since you neither can lessen your charms nor my love,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswswsw
but doubts caus'd by passion you never can blame,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsw
for they are not ill founded or you feel the same,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsws
to speed the sad moments away,anapaestic,10,29,6,swswssws
which by absence seem tedious and slow,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswsws
attend my dear girl to the lay,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
that love taught so sweetly to flow,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
thro' the regions of quiet and joy,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
as led by the muses you stray,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswwswsw
oh think that your damon is by,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswwswsw
and that such are the words he would say,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
such may be the words he might say,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
but what words can his passion impart,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswssws
or how shall he form the soft lay,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
to express what he feels at his heart,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
tho' thy voice gentle shepherd was clear,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsw
tho' the bower of contentment was thine,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswswsw
yet thy shepherdess was not so fair,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
yet thy love was not equal to mine,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
how sweet to the heart is the thought of tomorrow,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswswsw
how sweet when we can from futurity borrow,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswwswswsw
when wearisome sickness has taught me to languish,anapaestic,10,49,8,wsswswswswsw
let me hope ah how soon would it lessen my anguish,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswwsswsw
the pilgrim sojourning alone unbefriended,anapaestic,10,41,5,wswswswswssw
that at home and with care sympathetic attended,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswsswsw
when six days of labour each other succeeding,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswsswsswsw
what pleasure to think as the last is receding,anapaestic,10,46,9,wsswswswswsw
and when the vain shadows of time are retiring,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswswsw
the christian believing exulting expiring,anapaestic,10,41,5,wswswswswsww
the infidel then sees no joyous tomorrow,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsswsw
poor wretch can he feel without heartrending sorrow,anapaestic,10,51,8,wswswswsswsw
seek not in these paths to view,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswsw
dryads green or naiads blue,trochaic,8,27,5,swswsws
such as haunt at eve or dawn,trochaic,8,28,7,wswswsw
a enville's lake orb hagley's lawn,trochaic,8,34,6,wswswsws
such as sport onc worfield's meads,trochaic,8,34,6,wwswsws
such as shenstone's genius leads,trochaic,8,32,5,wwswsws
o'er vale and hill and to their care,trochaic,8,36,8,wswswsws
consigns his waves and woodlands fair,trochaic,8,37,6,wswswsws
while the muses vacant stray,trochaic,8,28,5,wwswsws
and echo wants her sweetest lay,trochaic,8,31,6,wswswsws
long long may those unrival'd shine,trochaic,8,35,6,wswswsws
nor shall my temp'rate breast repine,trochaic,8,36,6,wswswsws
so music lend her willing aid,trochaic,8,29,6,wswswsws
to gladden this ignoble shade,trochaic,8,29,5,wswswsws

and defeated his hopes by the help of the jug,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswswswsw
had taken too freely the cheeruping cup,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswsswsw
and repeated the dose till it laid her quite up,anapaestic,10,47,10,swswswswswsw
colin sent for the doctor with sorrowful face,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswwswswwsw
he gave him his fee and he told him her case,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswswswswsw
quoth galen i'll do what i can for your wife,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
but indeed she's so bad that i fear for her life,anapaestic,10,48,11,swswwswwswsw
in counsel there's safety e'en send for another,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswsswsswswsw
for if she shou'd die folks will make a strange pother,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswsw
and say that i lost her for want of good skill,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
or of better advice or in short what they will,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwsswswswsws
says colin your judgment there's none can dispute,anapaestic,10,49,8,wsswswswsws
and if physic can cure her i know yours will do't,anapaestic,10,49,11,wwswswswswsw
but if after all she shou'd happen to die,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
and they say that you kill'd her i'll swear 'tis a lye,anapaestic,10,54,12,wswswswwswsw
'tis the husband's chief business whatever ensue,anapaestic,10,48,7,wswswswsswsw
and whoever finds fault i'll be shot if i do,anapaestic,10,44,10,swsswswswsww
the slightest of favours bestow'd by the fair,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswsws
with rapture we take and with transport we wear,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
but a mosswoven rosebud eliza from thee,anapaestic,10,39,7,wwswswswswsw
a wellpleasing gift to a monarch would be,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
ah that illness too cruel forbidding should stand,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
and refuse me the gift from thine own lovely hand,anapaestic,10,49,10,wsswwswswsws
with joy i receive it with pleasure will view,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
reminded of thee by its odour and hue,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
sweet rose let me tell thee tho' charming thy bloom,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswswsw
tho' thy fragrance exceeds saba's richest perfume,anapaestic,10,49,7,swsswswwssws
thy breath to eliza's hath no fragrance in't,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswswssw
and thy bloom is but dull to her cheeks blushing tint,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswssw
yet alas my fair flower that bloom will decay,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsws
and all thy fine beauties soon wither away,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswswssws
tho' pluck'd by her hand to whose touch thou must own,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswswsw
harsh and rough is the cygnet's most delicate down,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswwsw
thou too snowy hand nay i mean not to preach,anapaestic,10,44,10,swsswswswsw
but the rose lovely moralist suffer to teach,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswwsw
extol not fond maiden thy beauties o'er mine,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
they too are shortliv'd and they too must decline,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsw
and small in conclusion the difference appears,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswswssws
in the bloom of few days or the bloom of few years,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw

let me in this rustic temple,trochaic,8,28,6,wswwswsw
lissy meet the muse and you,trochaic,8,27,6,swswsws
i am monarch of all i survey,anapaestic,10,28,7,swswswsws
my right there is none to dispute,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
from the center all round to the sea,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
i am lord of the fowl and the brute,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
oh solitude where are the charms,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
that sages have seen in the face,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
better dwell in the midst of alarms,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
than reign in this horrible place,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwswsw
i am out of humanity's reach,anapaestic,10,28,6,wswswswsw
i must finish my journey alone,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsws
never hear the sweet music of speech,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
i start at the sound of my own,anapaestic,10,30,8,wswswsws
the beasts that roam over the plain,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
my form with indifference see,anapaestic,10,29,5,swswswsw
they are so unacquainted with man,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswswsw
their tameness is shocking to me,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
society friendship and love,anapaestic,10,27,4,wsswswsw
divinely bestow'd upon man,anapaestic,10,26,4,wswsswsw
oh had i the wings of a dove,anapaestic,10,28,8,wswswsws
how soon wou'd i taste you again,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
my sorrows i then might assuage,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
in the ways of religion and truth,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsw
might learn from the wisdom of age,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswwswsw
and be cheer'd by the fallies of youth,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
religion what treasure untold,anapaestic,10,29,4,wsswssws
resides in that heav'nly word,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswwsws
more precious than silver and gold,anapaestic,10,34,6,wsswswsw
or all that this earth can afford,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
but the sound of the church going bell,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswswsws
these vallies and rocks never heard,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswwssws
ye winds that have made me your sport,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
convey to this desolate shore,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswwswsw
some cordial endearing report,anapaestic,10,29,4,wswswsws
of a land i shall visit no more,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswswsw
my friends do they now and then send,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
a wish or a thought after me,anapaestic,10,28,7,wswswsws
o tell me i yet have a friend,anapaestic,10,29,8,wswswsws
though a friend i am never to see,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswswsw
how fleet is a glance of the mind,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
compar'd with the speed of its flight,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
the tempest itself lags behind,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
and the swift winged arrows of light,anapaestic,10,36,7,wwswswsw
when i think of my own native land,anapaestic,10,34,8,swswswsws
in a moment i seem to be there,anapaestic,10,30,8,swswswsws
but alas recollection at hand,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswswsw
soon hurries me back to despair,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
but the sea fowl is gone to her nest,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
the beast is laid down in his lair,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswsws
ev'n here is a season of rest,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswwswsw
and i to my cabbin repair,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswwssws
there is mercy in ev'ry place,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
and mercy encouraging thought,anapaestic,10,29,4,wswswsws
gives even affliction a grace,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
and reconciles man to his lot,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
i lives in a neat little cottage,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
on sundays i dresses me handsome,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswswsw
i goes to the sign of the anchor,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
to wait till the lads are all ready,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
o lozes o' me we are merry,anapaestic,10,26,7,wswswswsw
dick spriggins he acts sae like players,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
and first he comes in for king richard,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
he wad part with his kingdom for horses,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsws
and then he comes in for young roma,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
i's just fit to drop whilst he's talking,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsw
o lozes o' me it is moving,anapaestic,10,26,7,wswswswsw
and then he looks up at a window,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
and then he lets wit' at she's talking,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
but i think she caws out on squire roma,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswswsw
then up wi' dick spriggins for ever,anapaestic,10,35,7,wwswsswsw
may his bairns be as honest as he's been,anapaestic,10,40,9,wswswswsws
sir walter returned from the far holy land,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswsswswsws
but such precious blood as now darkened his sword,anapaestic,10,49,9,swsswswswsw
fast fluttered his heart as his own castle towers,anapaestic,10,49,9,wsswswswswsw
my wife and my son he exclaimed while his tears,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
for terror now whispered the wife he had left,anapaestic,10,45,9,wsswswswsws
the child he had claspt in his farewel embrace,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswssws
then sighing he thought of his editha's tears,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
and her accents of love while she fervently cried,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
and then he remembered in language half formed,anapaestic,10,46,8,wswswswswsw
while scarcely he now can believe as a man,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
but should he not live to escape from that fear,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
nor stopped he again till his own castle moat,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswssw
't was daybreak yet still past the windows he saw,anapaestic,10,49,10,swswswswswsw
blest sight that she lives he exclaimed with smile,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswsws
for stranger to sloth and on business intent,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
and see through the castle all busy appear,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswsswssws
that instant the knight by the warder was seen,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
and while loud blew the horn now a smile now a tear,anapaestic,10,51,12,wwswswswswsw
'tis i my loved vassals the warrior exclaimed,anapaestic,10,45,8,swswsswswsws
who breathless and speechless soon rushed to his arms,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswswswsw
and dost thou still love me he uttered when first,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
she tried to reply but in vain while her sobs,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswswwswsw
behold how i'm changed how i'm scarred he exclaimed,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswwswswsws
thou hast bled for thy god she replied and each scar,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
but where is my child he cried pale with alarm,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswwswswsws
and comes he not with you she said then some woe,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
what meanest thou my love when to manhood he grew,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswwswsw
'o let me' he cried 'to the holy land go,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswswsw
'perchance my young arm by the cause nerved with strength,anapaestic,10,57,10,wswswswswsw
and the brave christian knights in reward of my zeal,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswsswsw
'and think'st thou' i said 'with the son i can part,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsw
no hope not i'll add to the fears of the wife,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswswsw
i ceased and his head on my bosom reclined,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswssws
when parting his ringlets i saw the big tears,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
the sight overcame me 'most loved' i exclaimed,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswswswsws
thy mother will gladly to dry up thy tears,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswsws
he kissed me he thanked me i armed him myself,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswss
so lovely he looked that the mother's fond fears,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
he went then how long has my warrior been gone,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
indeed then he scarcely could reach the far land,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswwswswsws
i told him my walter what armour was yours,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
in hopes of your meeting alas he returned,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswwswswsws
a friend whom i loved from the dawning of youth,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
fell fighting beside me and thus he exclaimed,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswsws
'and must i then die ere the flag of the cross,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
but grant me loved walter this dying request,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswssws
'my armour well tried and my falchion my shield,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
't would sooth me to know when the victory comes on,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswwswsw
i granted his wish and his arms i assumed,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
and marked with delight that his last closing look,anapaestic,10,50,9,swswswswssw
yet now this remembrance so dear to my heart,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
since but for this change on the field of the fight,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsw
but if he has fought and has fallen my love,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
a fear so illfounded if alfred had died,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
yet vainly he strove by the father's proud hopes,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
he feared for the life of his boy though with smiles,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
and more and more forced grew the smile on his lip,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
at length he exclaimed from the field of renown,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswsws
i grieve that i won it a saracen chief,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswswsw
when lo as i claimed him my prisoner and prize,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswsswsw
'i'm new to the battle' he cried 'and this prize,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswsws
nor will i the conquest resign but with life,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
his daring enraged me for mine seemed the stroke,anapaestic,10,48,9,wsswswswsws
besides from his bosom depended no cross,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswwswswsws
but surely my walter the daring bespoke,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswssws
so many your laurels that one you could spare,anapaestic,10,45,9,wsswswswsws
no editha no martial pride steeled my heart,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
he fought like a hero but vainly he fought,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswsswswsw
o illfated youth how i bleed for his fate,anapaestic,10,41,9,swsswswswsw
had armed him and blest him and prays for his life,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
but never again shall he gladden her eyes,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
o walter i tremble lest you in return,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswwsws
say did not the cross when your victim he fell,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
that symbol of him full of meekness and love,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
yes pity shame penitence seized on my soul,anapaestic,10,42,8,wsswswswsws
methought as he lay and in agony groaned,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswwswsw
his casque i unlaced and i chafed his cold brow,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsw
so young and so lovely he seemed that i wept,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
he saw my distress and his last dying grasp,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswssw
and then with a look i shall never forget,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswssws
but what's this memorial with cheek deadly pale,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswsws
this scarf from his bosom he uttered no more,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswsswswsw
ah then in her danger her pale look of death,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
o father accurst she exclaimed in that youth,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
we've hed sec a durdum at gobbleston parish,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswsswsswsw

what is't then but law that stands by us,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
and as to being parfet and parfet,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsws
when home we return after youth has been spending,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswwsw
and many a slow year has been wasting and ending,anapaestic,10,48,10,wsswswswsswsw
we often seem lost in the once wellknown places,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswsswsw
and sigh to find age has so furrow'd dear faces,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsww
for the rose that has faded the eye still keeps mourning,anapaestic,10,56,11,wwswwswswswsw
and weeps every change that it sees on returning,anapaestic,10,48,9,swsswswswswsw
should we miss but a tree where we us'd to be playing,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswwsw
or find the wood cut where we saunter'd amaying,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswssw
if the yewseat's away or the ivy's awanting,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswwsswsw
we hate the fine lawn and the newfashion'd planting,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswssw
each thing call'd improvement seems blacken'd with crimes,anapaestic,10,57,8,wswswswswsw
if it tears up one record of blissful old times,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswsswswsw
when many a spring had call'd forth the sweet flowers,anapaestic,10,53,10,wsswswswswsw
and many an autumn had painted the bowers,anapaestic,10,41,8,wsswswswswsw
i came to the place where life had its beginning,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswwswswswsw
taking root with the groves that around me were springing,anapaestic,10,57,10,swswswswswwsw
when i found them all gone 'twas like dear friends departed,anapaestic,10,59,11,wwswwswswswsw
and i walk'd where they us'd to be half broken hearted,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswwswswswsw
when distant one bower my fancy still haunted,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswswsw
'twas hung round with woodbine my jessy had planted,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswsswsw
i ran to the spot where a weak flower remaining,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswwswswsswsw
could just nod its head to approve my complaining,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsww
a tear for a dewdrop i hid in its fringes,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswwswswswsw
and sigh'd then to think what one's pleasures unhinges,anapaestic,10,54,9,wswswswsswsw
but ah what is that to the friends oft estranging,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswwswsws
their manners still more than their looks daily changing,anapaestic,10,56,9,wsswswswswsw
where the heart us'd to warm to find civil behaviour,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswswswsswsw
make us wish we had stay'd from our country for ever,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswwswsww
with the sweet days of youth in our fancies still glowing,anapaestic,10,57,11,wswswswwswsww
and the love of old friends with old time ever growing,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswswswsw
when severest foes impending,trochaic,8,28,4,swswswsw
unexpected joys attending,trochaic,8,25,3,swswswsw
though to fortune's frowns subjected,trochaic,8,36,5,wwswswsw
servile souls are soon dejected,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
prithee friend why then so serious,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsws
melancholy grows imperious,trochaic,8,26,3,swswswsws
be it business love or sorrow,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswswsw
bid them call again tomorrow,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsw
when the soft tear steals silently down from the eye,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswwsw
take no note of its course nor detect the slow sigh,anapaestic,10,51,11,swswswswswsw
from some spring of shy sorrow its origin flows,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswsswswsw
some tender remembrance that weeps as it goes,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
ah it is not to say what will bring to the mind,anapaestic,10,47,12,wswswswwswsw
the sweet joys departed the friends left behind,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswsws
a tune or a song or the time of the year,anapaestic,10,40,11,wswswswswsw
strikes the key of reflection and moans in the ear,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsws
thro' the gay scenes of youth the remembrancer strays,anapaestic,10,53,9,swswswswswsw
till mem'ry steps back on old pleasures to gaze,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
fleeting shadows they seem that glide calmly away,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswswswswsw
the remains of past hours and the ghosts of a day,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswsswwswsw
when we set out in life every thing has its charms,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswsswswsw
enkindles the fancy and all the heart warms,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
'tis this makes us look on the joys that are past,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
with an eye that turns coolly to glance on the last,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsws
let the tear then flow on nor mark the full eye,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswswsw
'tis the soul's secret off'ring no mortal should spy,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswsswswsw
few hearts are prepar'd for a rite so divine,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswsws
when the feelings alone sacrifice at the shrine,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwswswswswsw
when the sunbeams of joy gild the morn of our days,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswswswsw
and the soft heart is warm'd both with hope and with praise,anapaestic,10,59,12,wwswswswswsw
new pleasures new prospects still burst on the view,anapaestic,10,51,9,wsswswswsws
and the phantom of bliss in our walks we pursue,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
what tho' tangl'd in brakes or withheld by the thorn,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswswswsw
such sorrows of youth are but pearls of the morn,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
as they gem the light leaf in the fervour of day,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswwswsw
the warmth of the season dissolves them away,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswwswswsws
in the noontide of life though not robb'd of their fire,anapaestic,10,55,11,wwswswswswwsw
the warm wishes abate and the spirits retire,anapaestic,10,44,8,swsswswwssws
thus pictures less glowing give equal delight,anapaestic,10,45,7,wswswswswsw
when reason just tints them with shades of the night,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswsw
reflection's slow shadow steals down the gay hill,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsw
though as yet you may shun the soft shade as you will,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswswsww
and on hope fix your eye till the brightness so clear,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswwswsw
shall hang on its lid a dim trembling tear,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswsw
next the shades of mild evening close gently around,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsws
and lengthen'd reflection must stalk o'er the ground,anapaestic,10,52,8,wswswswswsw
through her lantern of magic past pleasures are seen,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswsswswsw
and we then only know what our daydreams have been,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwswsw
on the painted illusion we gaze while we can,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswswswswsw
though we often exclaim what a bauble is man,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswwswsw
in youth but a gewgaw in age but a toy,anapaestic,10,38,10,wswwswswsws
the same empty trifle as man and as boy,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswsswswsw
what nature alas has denied,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswswsws
to the delicate growth of our isle,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
art has in a measure supplied,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswwssws
and winter is deck'd with a smile,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
see mary what beauties i bring,anapaestic,10,30,6,wsswswsw
from the shelter of that sunny shed,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
where the flow'rs have the charms of the spring,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswsws
though abroad they are frozen and dead,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
'tis a bow'r of arcadian sweets,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswswsw
where flora is still in her prime,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
a fortress to which she retreats,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
from the cruel assaults of the clime,anapaestic,10,36,7,wwswswsw
while earth wears a mantle of snow,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsw
these pinks are as fresh and as gay,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
as the fairest and sweetest that blow,anapaestic,10,37,7,wwsswswsw
on the beautiful bosom of may,anapaestic,10,29,6,swswswsws
see how thcy have safely surviv'd,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswswssws
the frowns of a sky so severe,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
such mary's true love that has liv'd,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
through many a turbulent year,anapaestic,10,29,5,wsswswsw
the charms of the late blowing rose,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
seem grac'd with a livelier hue,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswwswsw
and the winter of sorrow best shows,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
the truth of a friend such as you,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
when the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
and the meadows their beauty have lost,anapaestic,10,38,7,wwsswswsw
when nature's disrob'd of her mantle of green,anapaestic,10,45,8,wsswswswsws
and the streams are fast bound with the frost,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswsws
while the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold,anapaestic,10,53,8,wwswswswsswsw
as bleak the winds northerly blow,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsw
and the innocent flocks run for warmth to the fold,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
with their fleeces besprinkled with snow,anapaestic,10,40,6,wwsswswsw
in the yard when the cattle are fodder'd with straw,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswsswswsw
and they send forth their breath like a steam,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswsws
and the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsws
flakes of ice that she finds in the cream,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
when the sweet countrymaiden as fresh as a rose,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswsswswsw
as she carelessly trips often slides,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
and the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shews,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
all the charms that her modesty hides,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsw
when the lads and the lasses for company join'd,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswsswswsw
in a croud round the embers are met,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind,anapaestic,10,49,10,swsswsswswsw
and of ghosts till they're all in a sweat,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
heaven grant in this season it may be my lot,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswwswswsws
with the nymph whom i love and admire,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
while the icicles hang from the eves of my cot,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswswsw
i may thither in safety retire,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswswsws
where in neatness and quiet and free from surprize,anapaestic,10,50,9,wwswswwswsws
we may live and no hardships endure,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
nor feel any turbulent passions arise,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswwssws
but such as each other may cure,anapaestic,10,31,7,wwswswsw
should i e'er become parson for so i'm inclin'd,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwswswswwsws
may i get a snug benefice pat to my mind,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswswsws
large enough to allow of a wife at my table,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswwswwsw
a cow in my yard and a nag in my stable,anapaestic,10,39,11,wswswswswwsw
may my flock n'er embroil me in quarrels and strife,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswsswswwswsw
in good humour i'd live all the days of my life,anapaestic,10,47,11,swswswswswsw
and die before tir'd of myself or my wife,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsw
with a friend or two near me of equal degree,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswwswsw
as like me in all things as pea is to pea,anapaestic,10,41,11,wswswswswsw
on a pudding and joint who contented can dine,anapaestic,10,45,9,wwswswswswsw
with a glass of old port and october divine,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswssws
may my offerings and tythes make me always appear,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
with a clean tho' coarse shirt ev'ry day in the year,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
for of all living things not excepting a swine,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswsswswswsw
the beastliest of beasts is a beastly divine,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswwswsw
may i ne'er grow too grave not to join in the fun,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
when my lord cracks a joke or the squire cuts a pun,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswswswwswsw
for if life is a jest as the wisest have spoke,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswwswsw
he lives the best life then who cuts the best joke,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsw
with no mystical learning i'd trouble my head,anapaestic,10,45,8,swsswswswwsw
relying on faith which will do in its stead,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswsw
with knowledge enough heaven's gates to unlock,anapaestic,10,46,7,wswswsswsws
and to take the strait road there along with my flock,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswswswswsw
with a bottle or two of prime wine on my shelf,anapaestic,10,46,11,wwswswswswsw
to recur to whene'er i am tir'd of myself,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswsswwswss
and a good natur'd muse to retire to at leisure,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswsswswswwsw
who will wrap me in rhimes and inspire me with measure,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswwsw
to enjoy what i have without wishing for more,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswssww
for contentment with little is doubling one's store,anapaestic,10,51,8,wswswsswsswsw
and when i am gone may my successor say,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswwswswsws
he's gone and i wish i could live the same way,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
for his flock ne'er embroil'd him in quarrels or strife,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswwswsw
in good humour he liv'd all the days of his life,anapaestic,10,48,11,swswswswswsw
and died before tir'd of himself or his wife,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
all i ask of bounteous heav'n,trochaic,8,29,6,wwswswsw
in a cottage sweet retirement,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsws
far from town and all its vices,trochaic,8,31,7,wswswwsw
passing all my days serenely,trochaic,8,28,5,swswswsws
far from ball and masquerade,trochaic,8,28,5,swswsws
far from courtly pomp and fashion,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
distant from the madding croud,trochaic,8,30,5,swswsws
quitting smoak for silver fountains,trochaic,8,35,5,swswswsw
ease and comfort peace and plenty,trochaic,8,33,6,swswswsw
every joy that can be wish'd for,trochaic,8,32,7,swswswsws
with the lark each morn arising,trochaic,8,31,6,wwswswsw
but contentment sweet possessing,trochaic,8,32,4,swswswsw
each new day my maker praising,trochaic,8,30,6,swswswsw
thanking heav'n for ev'ry blessing,trochaic,8,34,5,swswswsw
one thing more i ask of heaven,trochaic,8,30,7,wswswsw
one whose heart is ever constant,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswswsw
blest with judgment sound and clear,trochaic,8,35,6,swswsws
not the clown or foolish coxcomb,trochaic,8,32,6,wwswswsw
gentle as the evening breezes,trochaic,8,29,5,swswswsw
fresher than the summer morning,trochaic,8,31,5,swswswsw
smart and witty mild in manners,trochaic,8,31,6,swswswsw
free from flatt'ry pride and folly,trochaic,8,34,6,swswswsw
i desire not pow'r or riches,trochaic,8,28,6,swsswswsws
they are not the joys i wish for,trochaic,8,32,8,wswswsws
we of late had a terrible rout in our house,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswsswswsw
if i happen'd to speak i was sure of a souse,anapaestic,10,44,11,wwswswswswsw
my mamma had the toothach and i felt the smart,anapaestic,10,46,10,wsswwswswsws
o steel i for ever will value thy art,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswsswswsw
both children and servants to thee are beholden,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswwswsw
let them do what they would they were sure of a scolding,anapaestic,10,56,12,wswswswwswwsw
athenians i humbly beseech you explain,anapaestic,10,38,6,wswswswswsws
why the tongue cannot rest when the teeth are in pain,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswsswswswsw
the death song,anapaestic,10,14,3,wsw
written for and adapted to an original indian air,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswswsswswsw
the sun sets in night and the stars shun the day,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
but glory remains when their lights fade away,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswsswswsws
begin you tormentors your threats are in vain,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
for the son of alknomook will never complain,anapaestic,10,44,8,wwswswswssws
remember the arrows he shot from his bow,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswswsw
why so slow do you wait till i shrink from the pain,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswswswwswsw
no the son of alknomook shall never complain,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswswssws
remember the wood where in ambush we lay,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
and the scalps which we bore from your nation away,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwssws
now the flame rises fast you exult in my pain,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswsswswswsw
but the son of alknomook can never complain,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswssws
i go to the land where my father is gone,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswswsw
his ghost shall rejoice in the fame of his son,anapaestic,10,46,10,swswswwswsw
death comes like a friend to relieve me from pain,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
and thy son o alknomook has scorn'd to complain,anapaestic,10,47,9,wwswswswswsw
come to me and put thine sweet eyes,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
to put slander within my mind,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
of the old and bad trite stale kind,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
what false lines do impinge thy name,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
the well known lord and lady blare,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
such words i will not yea believe,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
since without gens how they deceive,anapaestic,10,35,6,wswswsws
the hot fire of this flames flambeau,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
will burn scurrilous page i know,anapaestic,10,32,6,swswswsw
then with glaive on this pole ill take,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
their head clean off for they names sake,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswsws
i recall to our life when she came,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
and for long years few knew who she was,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
two decades and more still theres oerload,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswsws
of mega bits and bytes thrown to us,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
and what a contradiction it is,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswswsw
no one has refrained from sharing views,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
and i oft feel ignorance is zen,anapaestic,10,31,7,swswswsws
but today it might drown us in doubt,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
time there was when it seemed our asset,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
such is shy maidens felicity,anapaestic,10,28,5,wswsswsws
but mired with opinions dressed as lie,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
so enchanted was sun by queen sea,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
as he sat near some clouds high above,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
he began sliding down stealthily,anapaestic,10,32,5,swswswsws
till he touched the dark face of his love,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswsws
then a third lover looked on the face,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
rosy heavens with deep purple lace,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
night embraced lovely sea sun was gone,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
such poor plight how can forever conceal,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswssws
who will write future in black and white,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsw
this surveyed,anapaestic,10,13,2,wsw
in solitude,anapaestic,10,11,2,wsws
i must look very deep in my soul,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswswsw
that will help me get close to my goal,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
clear i see as a child i was free,anapaestic,10,33,9,swswswsws
brought to church i was taught god to love,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswsws
down a path that would lead to above,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
for my heart and my soul lived for god,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswsws
knowing he was my staff and my rod,anapaestic,10,34,8,swswswsws
now my hate strongly started to burn,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswswsw
all this hate in me screamed set me free,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
i am saved by his grace every day,anapaestic,10,33,8,swswswswsw
im at peace and my spirit is free,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswswsw
free to fly with these wings god gave me,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
i will dread octobers spell,anapaestic,10,27,5,wwswsws
it only comes but once a year,anapaestic,10,29,7,wswswsws
but mummys cell phone gets a tweet,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
she gets unraveled in the sheets,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
and from the gauze that trips her feet,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswsws
ghouls in shadows want to play,anapaestic,10,30,6,swswsws
does he stand a ghost of chance,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsw
to take her to the midnight dance,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
our cat has groomed her black coat sleek,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswsws
then hops upon the fence to sneak,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
a peek into the living room,anapaestic,10,27,6,wswswsws
where dad weaves magic like a goon,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
embarrassed is a family clan,anapaestic,10,28,5,wswswswsw
they toss his magic in the can,anapaestic,10,30,7,wswswsws
a wartnosed witch gets on her broom,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
but preteen feet cant fly or zoom,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsw
until she cleans her messy room,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
the bedrooms cleaned with spit and shine,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswsws
while brother dares to take his time,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
he plans to fill his sisters bag,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
with tasty toads and wormy slime,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
i hide and dread the harvest moon,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
all hollows eve is coming soon,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
i thought id write some poetry,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
just for the fun that it would be,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
so i went to the web to see,anapaestic,10,27,8,wswswsws
what it said,anapaestic,10,12,3,wsw
about how to write poems just for me,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsws
i ran into words like iambic and tercet,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsww
and other ones that i had never met,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsws
there was even a thing called a quatrain,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswswsw
that confused and corrupted my brain,anapaestic,10,36,6,swswswsws
stanzas are neat if they get the right beat,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswswsw
with the meter which id no doubt delete,anapaestic,10,39,8,wwswswswsws
you also have tetrameter and pentameter,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswwsswswsw
which are terms i dont think are neat,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
long ago i did write in rhyme,anapaestic,10,29,7,swswswsw
but just to friends who didnt mind,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsw
id write some limericks or lyrics to sing,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswswsw
that were not important,anapaestic,10,23,4,wwswsw
and didnt mean a thing,anapaestic,10,22,5,wswsw
but as i write now and look into how,anapaestic,10,36,9,wswswswsws
i find myself stymied by words to allow,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswwswsws
i read such things as trochee,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsw
and anapest and even dactyl,anapaestic,10,27,5,wswswswsw
they are words i just read,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswsws
and dont really feel,anapaestic,10,20,4,swsws
a measure in feet,anapaestic,10,17,4,wswsw
with stresses on heavy or light,anapaestic,10,31,6,wsswswsw
and then they repeat,anapaestic,10,20,4,wwsws
they do form the meter,anapaestic,10,22,5,wwswsw
which makes the poem complete,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswssws
i may just give up and write more in prose,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswsws
my friends will give thanks and id smell like a rose,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
but i do get such joy with the lines in a verse,anapaestic,10,47,12,wswswswwswsw
which doesnt make sense,anapaestic,10,23,4,wswsw
and just makes it worse,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsw
free verse would just boggle my mind,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsw
it really wont matter,anapaestic,10,21,4,wsswsw
what rules i would shatter,anapaestic,10,26,5,wswwsw
as long as i make the words rhyme,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswsws
limerick gimmerick,anapaestic,10,18,2,sswsws
jason of pendleton,anapaestic,10,18,3,sswsws
tried doubledactyls while,anapaestic,10,25,3,wswsws
fearing the worst,anapaestic,10,17,3,swsw
uhohspaghettio,anapaestic,10,14,1,wswsws
theyre all bassackwards cuz,anapaestic,10,27,4,sswswsw
hes used to anapest,anapaestic,10,19,4,wswsws
an old goat in a boat rowed off shore,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
he caught perch in his search and much more,anapaestic,10,43,9,swswswsws
theres trout in his coat,anapaestic,10,24,5,wswsw
eau de fish was his scent evermore,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
how they laugh and they point as they whisper bout me,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswswswwswsw
and they only can see what their shallow eyes see,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
though my surface is not picture perfect for show,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswswswswsw
how this heart bleeds with purpose they never could know,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswswswwsw
of the horrors and trials my soul has survived,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswsws
of the hell and the fury that killed me alive,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswwswswsws
ive been stripped of my honor and burnt at the stake,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswsswswsw
made to live in a nightmare but could not awake,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsws
the atrocities bared on my face in display,anapaestic,10,42,8,swsswswswsws
oh they cause you to cringe as your eyes turn away,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsws
and the truth is my scars are much deeper than face,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswsw
just a trace has been left of humanitys grace,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswswsw
as they came in the dead of the night whilst we slept,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
through the house down the hall they so silently crept,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswsw
i was tied to a chair and with sickened disgust,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswwssws
made to watch as my daughters defiled with their lust,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswsswsw
oh my sweet baby girls who i failed to protect,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
now your innocence lives in my heart where youre kept,anapaestic,10,53,10,swsswswwswsw
as the flames and your screams took the last of my peace,anapaestic,10,56,12,wwswswswswsw
melting skin joined my tears as your souls found release,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswswswsws
fall the leaves of the forest tho death has yet passed,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswswsws
unto moonlit shadows within crypts hidden rot,anapaestic,10,45,7,swswsswswssw
oh but lo to the truth they are blind it is naught,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
theyre but fragmented feelings of love left aghast,anapaestic,10,50,8,wswswswswsws
from her heart they were torn bits he stabbed then forgot,anapaestic,10,57,11,wwswwswswsws
the shadows cannot hide nor contain the scars wrought,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswsswswswsw
left to wander until retribution is brought,anapaestic,10,43,7,swswswswswsw
as the sky bleeds to twilight the sweetest disease,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswsswswsw
as a warm breeze courts eros at twilights advance,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswssws
till a feverish tango as all reason halts,anapaestic,10,41,8,wwswsswswsws
as the world falls from focus in dizzying strides,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswswsw
should the moon cast its toxin on amorous souls,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswwsw
the subject at hand will be somewhat informal,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswssw
i wonder each day what will be the new normal,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswwswsw
to find some brand new locks growing out of my ear,anapaestic,10,50,11,swswswsswwsw
and what of tomorrow morning when i awake,anapaestic,10,41,8,wwswswswswsw
will i find a limb afflicted with a strange ache,anapaestic,10,48,10,wwswswswswsw
will the pharmacy have some great cream or a pill,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
to assuage sudden change brought on by my ill,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswswswsw
i have chosen to find humor rather than stress,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswswsw
to keep our lives routine will cost us more money,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswwsw
to the edge of horizons and harmonys light,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswsswswsw
comes warm smiles to be found on the face of our hearts,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswswwswsw
this rapture so vibrant from the wealth of loves eyes,anapaestic,10,53,10,wswswswwswsw
was released and was felt when we cut through its veils,anapaestic,10,55,11,swswwswwswsw
to invite a new world to be filled with lifes needs,anapaestic,10,51,11,swswswswswsw
and claim peace from the soul with the years to be shared,anapaestic,10,57,12,wswswswwswsw
to welcome the mornings when the light rushes free,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswssw
and hinges on eyelids come open to adore,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswwsswswsws
the lovely jewels held in the life well treasure,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswwswsw
as we move through the days with a blissful intent,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwssws
when time becomes fleeting and the days become nights,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswswwswsw
unaware of the world and the time to have passed,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswwswwswsw
to spend our emotions when love found us worthy,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswssw
this payment to be made with the lips breathless kiss,anapaestic,10,53,10,wsswwswswsws
i was lost as the night wrapped its ebony shades,anapaestic,10,48,10,wwswswswswsw
round your lips like the petals on roses unfurled,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswsswssws
left me hopeless to shun a temptation like this,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswssww
though aware of the thorns and the danger they posed,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswwswwswsw
so i reached for your love and i bled and i cried,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
as i danced through the stems of your past and your life,anapaestic,10,56,12,wswswswwswsw
and was freed from my own hidden garden of pain,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswswsw
a poet was making such clatter,anapaestic,10,30,6,wsswsswsw
his friend ran to see whats the matter,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
or my poems cant be,anapaestic,10,19,5,wwswsw
in antiseptic pentameter,anapaestic,10,24,3,wswswswsw
his friend laughed at all of the chatter,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsw
the other didnt grasp the matter,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
so your poems will be,anapaestic,10,21,5,wwswsw
in antipasto pentameter,anapaestic,10,23,3,wswswswsw
my problem with glutens the matter,anapaestic,10,34,6,wswswswsw
and why i must make so much clatter,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
im allergic you see,anapaestic,10,19,4,swswsw
id get shakes and would be,anapaestic,10,26,6,wswsws
writing in spastic pentameter,anapaestic,10,29,4,sswswswsw
in a prayer anapestic,anapaestic,10,21,4,wwswsw
this form was to tick,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsw
tis the day after christmas the house is a mess,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswsswswsw
when will they restore order thats anyones guess,anapaestic,10,48,8,wwswswswswsw
this familys sluggish and tired as can be,anapaestic,10,41,8,wsswsswswsws
seven veggies mom will use her skills to disguise,anapaestic,10,49,9,wsswswswsws
all thats left shell transform it and serve it for days,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswswwswsw
daddy slips to the den to his favorite chair,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswwswwswsw
for a short winters napthen sees mom standing there,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswswsws
then a big pile of invoices for us awaits,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswswsws
we will pay them online now is no time to doze,anapaestic,10,46,11,wwswswswswsw
then up from the recliner poor pooped dad arose,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsws
i can see them but often are blurs undefined,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwswwswswsws
i can see them in beauty of lifes sweet ballet,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswwswswsws
every new day unfolds with its bright morning ray,anapaestic,10,49,9,swswswswswsws
in their river of insights where artistry streams,anapaestic,10,49,8,wwswswswswsw
inspiration flows from them in glorious beams,anapaestic,10,45,7,swsswswwswsw
gods most beautiful creatures of angels help me,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsw
angel love and directionsunup till sundown,anapaestic,10,42,6,wswswswsswsw
i cannot say how poems come to be,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswswsws
they come into my mind amazingly,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswswsws
i cannot say how i hunt down my words,anapaestic,10,37,9,wswswswsws
or then select a form to fit the theme,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswsws
or count the syllables for metered flow,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswsws
select the feet of two or more to show,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswswsws
that make the words behave or wildly prance,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsws
to then rewrite and add what i forgot,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsws
is an awesome reserve of a pot filled with gold,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwsswswswsws
in the form of gold coins to use up selfishly,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsws
theyll be wishes come true deep within to allot,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswswswswsw
like a resolute peace in each country on earth,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswswsw
find the cure for diseasestheir mysteries solved,anapaestic,10,48,7,wswswswswsw
so the curse of these monsters is truly dissolved,anapaestic,10,49,9,wwswwswswsws
find a way to stop hunger both here and abroad,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
make new laws so that violence does not erupt,anapaestic,10,45,9,wswswsswswsw
with her laws keep in sync in whatever we do,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswsswsw
theyll be wishes come true for mankind to behold,anapaestic,10,48,9,swsswswswsws
the first child with a brother who followed in time,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswsswswsw
and my teachers took time to encourage my urge,anapaestic,10,46,9,wwswswswswsw
i enjoyed my young years while i painted and penned,anapaestic,10,51,10,swswswswswsw
lots of canvas and paper used up without end,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswsswswsw
and enjoyed my new path of becoming a wife,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswswswsw
we worked hard every day and our life was so good,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswsswswwswsw
i wrote poems and painted whenever i could,anapaestic,10,42,8,swsswswswwsw
and i studied six years at an art gallery,anapaestic,10,41,9,wwsswswswsws
i enrolled in a college to study parttime,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswwsswswsw
a baand a minor in business for me,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsws
and i soon published poems of life and of heart,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswsswswsw
yet along in this time of my great writing spree,anapaestic,10,48,10,swswwswswssw
i worked hard every day as our business vp,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswsswswwswss
our dear children all married with families too,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswsswswsw
are involved happily in whatever they do,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsswsw
and one granddaughter married two thousand thirteen,anapaestic,10,51,7,wswswsswswsw
we are proud and so blessed and thank god up above,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswwswswsws
for our days and our life of good times filled with love,anapaestic,10,56,12,wwswswswswsw
but to my big surprise when that contest was done,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsww
my sad eyes saw in fact that my poem had not won,anapaestic,10,48,12,wswswswwsswsw
could not find what it meant anywhere on the site,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswswswsw
my head spun to fit in which of these it could be,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswswsww
now i still do not know what na represents,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswws
when your poem doesnt win in soup contest events,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswsswswswsw
i give praise and respect to the christ,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsw
his good grace as i ask is a win,anapaestic,10,32,9,swswswsws
in no way does no price mean no cost,anapaestic,10,36,9,swswswsws
for gods mercys a gift he presents,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
for eternity wasted expense,anapaestic,10,27,4,swswswsws
the real cost for our lord was his blood,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
and our god sends his spirit to flood,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
the new life with the powr of the cross,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswswswsws
sins a breach between man and his god,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
he deserves no mere shallow embrace,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
no believer with simply a nod,anapaestic,10,29,6,swswswsws
understands the full cost of his grace,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
does a friendship with god eer begin,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswssws
jesus christ wants obedience now,anapaestic,10,32,5,swswswsws
than to lay down your life for your friend,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswswsws
we set off on excursions within that domain,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsws
we began at a loss,anapaestic,10,18,5,swswsw
we embark on a most unpredictable task,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswswswsw
touring cadillac mountain with fog as a mask,anapaestic,10,44,8,swswswswswsw
by creating a fuss,anapaestic,10,18,4,swswsw
up the fiftytwo steps to attend to our need,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswswsw
we by chance run across,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsws
is it algae or lichen a fungus or fern,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswswsswswsw
a true whatzit for us,anapaestic,10,21,5,swswsw
i see fanciful lace mid inherent decay,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswswssws
i see whimsical bubbles entangled in play,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswsswswsw
i see change as our mood now reverses dismay,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsws
its an insight from moss,anapaestic,10,24,5,wwswsw
in a small grassy field,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsws
with the trees all around,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswsws
theres a fairy ring ancient and old,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
and at times you can hear,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswsws
perfect echoes of sound,anapaestic,10,23,4,wswsws
tis the music of ages untold,anapaestic,10,28,6,swswswsws
for the crickets keep time,anapaestic,10,26,5,wwswsw
to a waltz or a reel,anapaestic,10,20,6,wswsws
and the birds fill that lovely expanse,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
with the notes to a tune,anapaestic,10,24,6,wswsws
in the field where the butterflies dance,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsw
where the wildflowers bloom,anapaestic,10,27,4,wwsws
with a sweet perfume,anapaestic,10,20,4,wwsws
in a rainbow of colours and shades,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
where the maids hurry down,anapaestic,10,26,5,wswsws
from the hilltop town,anapaestic,10,21,4,wwsws
and the butterflies dance with the maids,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswsws
on a winged pirouette,anapaestic,10,21,4,wswsws
or a six legged slip,anapaestic,10,20,5,wswsws
and their wings flash in time,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswsws
to a bright scottish trip,anapaestic,10,25,5,wswsws
while the lassies turn round by the burn,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
where they splash in the stream,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswsws
or they lie and dream,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsw
where the bullfrogs thrum,anapaestic,10,25,4,wwsws
while the butterflies wing,anapaestic,10,26,4,wwswsw
and the hummingbirds hum,anapaestic,10,24,4,wwswsw
while the merry maids sing,anapaestic,10,26,5,wwswsw
dawn chorus trills arias in duet,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswswsws
not a dulcet tone morning to forget,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsws
rose shot with purl,anapaestic,10,19,4,wsws
a white wedding dress shimmers in sunlight,anapaestic,10,42,7,swsswswsws
rose petals curl,anapaestic,10,16,3,wsws
the fresh flush of a virgin prescribed writ,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswsws
the purity evident on soffit,anapaestic,10,28,5,wsswswswsw
rose throws to hurl,anapaestic,10,19,4,wsws
the serene still reflection in mirror,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswswsw
belie fervid brow tester an error,anapaestic,10,33,6,wswswswsws
rose bud unfurls,anapaestic,10,16,3,wsws
the first time i heard this i was in disbelief,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsws
as he readied to play he rosined a long bow,anapaestic,10,43,10,wwsswswswsws
on a hill far away the notes softly and slow,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswsswsw
i heard voices of angels in tune through it all,anapaestic,10,47,10,swsswswswsww
through it all the strange notes woefully made demand,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswwswsswsws
with small pricks of conscience from the musics tearful darts,anapaestic,10,61,10,swswswswswsws
with such lightness and patterns and passionfilled phrases,anapaestic,10,58,8,wswswsswswsww
do you deign to reply just to prop up your selfpride,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswswsw
and takes pride in the craft of his new devotee,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswsws
magnanimity faded as rivalries grew,anapaestic,10,35,5,swsswsswswsw
with the confidence born of a spirit secure,anapaestic,10,43,8,wwswswswssws
many veteran artists opine to be sure,anapaestic,10,37,7,swsswswsswsw
and the metrical rhythm and pacing they find,anapaestic,10,44,8,swsswsswswsw
so essential to verse in traditional form,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswswswswsw
with the internal metronome setting the norm,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswwsw
and the imagery seen in a free verse unbound,anapaestic,10,44,9,wwsswswswsws
by the strictures and structures of metrical scheme,anapaestic,10,51,8,wwswswswswsw
nontraditional verse deserves no less esteem,anapaestic,10,44,6,swsswswswsws
in the end all agree that emotions the key,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswswwsw
and the soul of the poet must yearn to be free,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswsswswsw
be the uncensored voice that will sometimes annoy,anapaestic,10,49,8,wswswswswsws
theres a river that twists in the mind,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswswsws
on crusades to the summit of rhyme,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswwswsw
where my phoenix of tropes and schemes live,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswsws
in a war to free dictions fair queen,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
where the soldiers of babel bemuse,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
and the modern day graceless regimes,anapaestic,10,36,6,wwsswssws
are in battles to stifle my muse,anapaestic,10,32,7,wwsswswsw
in my quest for her verse of prestige,anapaestic,10,37,8,swswswsws
i have traveled a nexus of words,anapaestic,10,32,7,wwsswswsw
with this lexis of language on siege,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
where the dissonant hum drum is heard,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
as i pin down my thoughts in a rush,anapaestic,10,35,9,swswswsws
as her essence of glory i brush,anapaestic,10,31,7,wwsswswsw
shes the queen muse that whispers within,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswssws
she supplies me the yarn that i spin,anapaestic,10,36,8,swswswsws
as she lends me her rhythm awhile,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswssws
its the moment her highness is freed,anapaestic,10,36,7,wwsswswsw
that the armies of dissonance fall,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
and the sound of perfection can bleed,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsw
in those lyrical sounds that enthrall,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswsws
i was born bronx new york in the year 'thirty nine,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsws

until nighttime delivers dark sky stars and moon,anapaestic,10,48,8,wswswsswswsw
i can feel them nearby when i'm writing commune,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswwswsw
with their spirit my deep thoughts instinctively tune,anapaestic,10,53,8,wwswswswswsw
and wherever i am within night or daydreams,anapaestic,10,43,8,swsswswswsww
glowing warm kindling bright for my choices to see,anapaestic,10,50,9,sswswswwswsw
god's most beautiful creatures of angels help me,anapaestic,10,48,8,swswswswswsw
both when seen and when hidden they fly guarantee,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsws
and he played with a flair of beauty and motif,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswwswswsws
without breaking his stride in the garden he played,anapaestic,10,51,9,wswswswwswsw
the heads bow their lips move the congregation prayed,anapaestic,10,53,9,wswswswswssw
not intending to preach someone issued the call,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsw
like a stradivari rosined strings strike their hearts,anapaestic,10,53,8,wwswswswswsw
oh why not tonight played commanding those at hand,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsws
at the end the blind man with the bow cross his chair,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswwswsw
swore he heard the soft voice seraphim singing slow,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswsswsws
saying now find the thing that was played if you care,anapaestic,10,53,11,sswswswwswsw
should you please rearrange the anagram below,anapaestic,10,45,7,wwswswswsws
after making the trip to bar harbor in maine,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswswsw
in the midst of events aggravating arcane,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswwssws
fifteen hundred feet high and sh shaking we ask,anapaestic,10,47,9,wsswswswwswsw
with alarm where's the bus,anapaestic,10,26,5,swswsw
safely back at sea level we all need to chill,anapaestic,10,45,10,sswswsswswsw
tell me who put the rest stop on top of a hill,anapaestic,10,46,12,wswswswswsws
giving vent to our steam we release it with skill,anapaestic,10,49,10,swswswswswsw
so we cuss as we scurry we snort and stampede,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswwswswsws
up the fifty two steps to attend to our need,anapaestic,10,44,10,wwswswswswsw
on the zig zag descent rather tetchy still teed,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswwswsw
a botanical gem symbiotic we learn,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswswswsw
a bizarre kind of growth some avoid with concern,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswswswsw
it's an insight from moss,anapaestic,10,25,5,wwswsw
so i queried some poets who dance 'cross our pages,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwsswswswswsw
with such lightness and patterns and passion filled phrases,anapaestic,10,59,9,wswswsswsswsw
when your guidance is sought by one earnest and wide eyed,anapaestic,10,57,11,wwsswswwswsws
do you deign to reply just to prop up your self pride,anapaestic,10,53,12,wswswswswswsw
do you tell her 'it's simple just read all you can,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsww
about me and my writing how fluid i am',anapaestic,10,39,9,wswswsswswsw
or perhaps you're a mentor by nature and offer,anapaestic,10,46,9,swswwswwsswsw
to pry open the portals and share like an author,anapaestic,10,48,10,swsswswswswsw
who reveals all his notes although mental they be,anapaestic,10,49,9,wswswswswsww
yes 'mong even the great ones we've heard of a few,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsww
so our resolute neophyte meets with the names,anapaestic,10,45,8,wwswsswswsws
those whose art she reads daily and counsel she claims,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswsswswsw
some are eager to share of their passion for rhyme,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswswsw
yes but what about consonance diction and sound,anapaestic,10,47,8,swswswswswsw
non traditional verse deserves no less esteem,anapaestic,10,45,7,swsswswswsws
in the end all agree that emotion's the key,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswswwsw
to give access to mystery tragedy joy,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsswswsw
let your passion be sovereign your unrivaled guide,anapaestic,10,50,8,swsswswswssw
you are artist at canvass palette at your side,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswsswsw
twas the night before christmas when all thro' the house,anapaestic,10,56,10,wswswsswswsw
not a creature was stirring not even a mouse,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswsswswsw
the children were nestled all snug in their beds,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsw
while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,anapaestic,10,50,9,wsswswswsws
nd mamma in her 'kerchief and i in my cap,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswwswswwsw
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,anapaestic,10,51,10,swsswswswsws
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,anapaestic,10,47,10,wswswswswwsw
sprang from the bed to see what was the matter,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswswsw
away to the window i flew like a flash,anapaestic,10,38,9,wswwswswsws
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash,anapaestic,10,44,9,wsswswswsws
the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswwswswsws
gave the lustre of mid day to objects below,anapaestic,10,43,9,swsswswswsws
when what to my wondering eyes should appear,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswwswswsws
but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer,anapaestic,10,47,8,wwsswswswswsw
with a little old driver so lively and quick,anapaestic,10,44,9,swsswsswswsw
i knew in a moment it must be st nick,anapaestic,10,37,10,wswwswswsws
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came,anapaestic,10,45,8,wswswswswsw
and he whistled and shouted and called them by name,anapaestic,10,51,10,wwsswswswsws
now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen,anapaestic,10,43,8,wsswswswswsw
on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen,anapaestic,10,42,9,wsswswswsswsw
to the top of the porch to the top of the wall,anapaestic,10,46,12,wswswswwswsw
now dash away dash away dash away all,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswsswsw
when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,anapaestic,10,48,10,wwswwswswsws
so up to the house top the coursers they flew,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too,anapaestic,10,48,10,wwswswswswsw
and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswswsw
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswsswswsws
as i drew in my head and was turning around,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswwswsw
down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswsswswsw
he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,anapaestic,10,51,12,wswswswwswsw
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswswswwsw
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back,anapaestic,10,41,10,wswswswswsw
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwsswsw
his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswwswswswsw
his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswwswswswsw
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,anapaestic,10,46,10,swsswswswsw
and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow,anapaestic,10,50,12,wswswswwswsw
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,anapaestic,10,46,11,wswswswswsw
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsws
he had a broad face and a little round belly,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswsswsw
that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswsww
he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf,anapaestic,10,45,10,wwswswswswsw
and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswswwswss
a wink of his eye and a twist of his head,anapaestic,10,41,11,wswswswswsw
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswswsw
he spoke not a word but went straight to his work,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswwswswsws
and laying his finger aside of his nose,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswswsw
and giving a nod up the chimney he rose,anapaestic,10,39,9,wswswswswsw
he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswwswswswsw
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle,anapaestic,10,49,11,swswwswwswwsw
but i heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsws
happy christmas to all and to all a good night,anapaestic,10,46,10,swsswswwswsw
when the sparklers have sparked and the cannons have boomed,anapaestic,10,59,10,wwswswswswsw
and the flags have been flown and the flowers have bloomed,anapaestic,10,58,11,wswswswwswsw
when the coleslaw arrives and the meat has been grilled,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswwswsw
and the children have played and the bellies are filled,anapaestic,10,55,10,wwswswswswsw
when the families have left after long fond good byes,anapaestic,10,53,10,wwsswswswswsw
and the tables are cleared we sit back with a sigh,anapaestic,10,50,11,wwswswswswsw
then we doze and digest with a satisfied smile,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswwswsw
and with fondness remember the day for awhile,anapaestic,10,45,8,wwswsswswsws
but perhaps in the midst of the party and fun,anapaestic,10,45,10,swswwswwswsw
we've lost sight of the way that our freedom was won,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswwswsw
let us never forget the great war that was fought,anapaestic,10,49,10,swsswswswsws
and the price for our freedom in blood dearly bought,anapaestic,10,52,10,wwswwswswsws
for the wisest of men said that truth sets you free,anapaestic,10,51,11,wwswswswswsw
and to let freedom ring truth was nailed to a tree,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswsws
now that i tying thy glass mask tightly,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsws
may gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswswswsw
as thou pliest thy trade in this devil's smithy,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
which is the poison to poison her prithee,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswsswswsws
he is with her and they know that i know,anapaestic,10,40,10,wswswswsws
where they are what they do they believe my tears flow,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswwswswsw
while they laugh laugh at me at me fled to the drear,anapaestic,10,52,12,wswwswswswwsw
empty church to pray god in for them i am here,anapaestic,10,46,11,swswswswwsww
grind away moisten and mash up thy paste,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsws
pound at thy powder i am not in haste,anapaestic,10,37,9,wswswswsws
better sit thus and observe thy strange things,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswswswsw
than go where men wait me and dance at the king's,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswswsw
that in the mortar you call it a gum,anapaestic,10,36,9,wswswswsws
ah the brave tree whence such gold oozings come,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswsws
and yonder soft phial the exquisite blue,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswswsw
sure to taste sweetly is that poison too,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsws
had i but all of them thee and thy treasures,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswswsw
what a wild crowd of invisible pleasures,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswsswsw
to carry pure death in an earring a casket,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswsswsw
a signet a fan mount a filigree basket,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswswsww
soon at the king's a mere lozenge to give,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswswsw
and pauline should have just thirty minutes to live,anapaestic,10,51,9,swswswswswsw
but to light a pastile and elise with her head,anapaestic,10,46,10,wwswswswswsw
and her breast and her arms and her hands should drop dead,anapaestic,10,58,12,wswswswwswsw
quick is it finished the colour's too grim,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswsswswsw
why not soft like the phial's enticing and dim,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswsswswsw
let it brighten her drink let her turn it and stir,anapaestic,10,50,11,swswswswswsw
and try it and taste ere she fix and prefer,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
what a drop she's not little no minion like me,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswsswswsw
that's why she ensnared him this never will free,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswswwswsw
the soul from those masculine eyes say no,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswswsw
to that pulse's magnificent come and go,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswswswsw
for only last night as they whispered i brought,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
my own eyes to bear on her so that i thought,anapaestic,10,44,11,wswswswswsw
could i keep them one half minute fixed she would fall,anapaestic,10,54,11,wwswswswswsw
shrivelled she fell not yet this does it all,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswswsw
not that i bid you spare her the pain,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
let death be felt and the proof remain,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswswsws
brand burn up bite into its grace,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
he is sure to remember her dying face,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswswsw
is it done take my mask off nay be not morose,anapaestic,10,45,11,wswswswswsws
it kills her and this prevents seeing it close,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswswsw
the delicate droplet my whole fortune's fee,anapaestic,10,43,7,wsswswswsws
if it hurts her beside can it ever hurt me,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswwswsw
now take all my jewels gorge gold to your fill,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswsws
you may kiss me old man on my mouth if you will,anapaestic,10,47,12,wswswswswsww
but brush this dust off me lest horror it brings,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
ere i know it next moment i dance at the king's,anapaestic,10,47,11,wswswsswswsw
listen my children and you shall hear,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
of the midnight ride of paul revere,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
on the eighteenth of april in seventy five,anapaestic,10,42,8,wswswsswswsw
hardly a man is now alive,anapaestic,10,25,6,wswswsws
who remembers that famous day and year,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswsws
he said to his friend 'if the british march,anapaestic,10,43,9,wswswswsws
by land or sea from the town to night,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswwsws
of the north church tower as a signal light,anapaestic,10,43,9,wwswswswsws
one if by land and two if by sea,anapaestic,10,32,9,swswswsws
and i on the opposite shore will be,anapaestic,10,35,8,swswswswsw
ready to ride and spread the alarm,anapaestic,10,34,7,swswswsws
through every middlesex village and farm,anapaestic,10,40,6,wsswswswsws
for the country folk to be up and to arm',anapaestic,10,41,10,wwswswswsws
then he said 'good night' and with muffled oar,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswswsws
silently rowed to the charlestown shore,anapaestic,10,39,6,swswswsws
just as the moon rose over the bay,anapaestic,10,34,8,wswswswsw
where swinging wide at her moorings lay,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswwsws
the somerset british man of war,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswswsw
a phantom ship with each mast and spar,anapaestic,10,38,8,wswswswsw
across the moon like a prison bar,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswwsws
and a huge black hulk that was magnified,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsws
by its own reflection in the tide,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
meanwhile his friend through alley and street,anapaestic,10,45,7,swswswsws
wanders and watches with eager ears,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
till in the silence around him he hears,anapaestic,10,39,8,wswswswsws
the muster of men at the barrack door,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsws
the sound of arms and the tramp of feet,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
and the measured tread of the grenadiers,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswwswsw
marching down to their boats on the shore,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
then he climbed the tower of the old north church,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswsws
by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswsws
to the belfry chamber overhead,anapaestic,10,30,5,swswswsws
and startled the pigeons from their perch,anapaestic,10,41,7,swswswsws
on the sombre rafters that round him made,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswswsw
masses and moving shapes of shade,anapaestic,10,33,6,sswswsws
by the trembling ladder steep and tall,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswsws
to the highest window in the wall,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
where he paused to listen and look down,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
a moment on the roofs of the town,anapaestic,10,33,8,wswswswsw
and the moonlight flowing over all,anapaestic,10,34,6,swswswsws
beneath in the churchyard lay the dead,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswwswsws
in their night encampment on the hill,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswsws
wrapped in silence so deep and still,anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsw
that he could hear like a sentinel's tread,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswswswsw
the watchful night wind as it went,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
creeping along from tent to tent,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
and seeming to whisper 'all is well',anapaestic,10,36,7,swswswsws
a moment only he feels the spell,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswswsw
of the place and the hour and the secret dread,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswsswwsws
of the lonely belfry and the dead,anapaestic,10,33,7,swswswsws
for suddenly all his thoughts are bent,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswswsw
on a shadowy something far away,anapaestic,10,31,6,swsswswsws
where the river widens to meet the bay,anapaestic,10,38,8,swswswswsw
a line of black that bends and floats,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswsws
on the rising tide like a bridge of boats,anapaestic,10,41,9,swswswswsw
meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,anapaestic,10,37,6,swswswsws
booted and spurred with a heavy stride,anapaestic,10,38,7,swswswsws
on the opposite shore walked paul revere,anapaestic,10,40,7,swsswswsws
now he patted his horse's side,anapaestic,10,30,6,swsswsws
now gazed at the landscape far and near,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
then impetuous stamped the earth,anapaestic,10,32,5,swswsws
and turned and tightened his saddle girth,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswsswsws
but mostly he watched with eager search,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswswsws
the belfry tower of the old north church,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsws
as it rose above the graves on the hill,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswswsw
lonely and spectral and sombre and still,anapaestic,10,40,7,swswswswsw
and lo as he looks on the belfry's height,anapaestic,10,41,9,wswswswsws
a glimmer and then a gleam of light,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswswsw
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswsswswsw
but lingers and gazes till full on his sight,anapaestic,10,44,9,wswswswswsw
a second lamp in the belfry burns,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswwsws
a hurry of hoofs in a village street,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsws
a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswwsswswsw
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswswswsw
that was all and yet through the gloom and the light,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
the fate of a nation was riding that night,anapaestic,10,42,9,swswsswswsw
and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight,anapaestic,10,52,11,wswswswswsw
kindled the land into flame with its heat,anapaestic,10,41,8,wswswswsws
he has left the village and mounted the steep,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswsswswsw
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep,anapaestic,10,43,8,swswswswsw
is the mystic meeting the ocean tides,anapaestic,10,37,7,swswswswsw
and under the alders that skirt its edge,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswsws
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge,anapaestic,10,42,10,wswswswsws
is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswswswsws
it was twelve by the village clock,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
when he crossed the bridge into medford town,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswsws
he heard the crowing of the cock,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
and the barking of the farmer's dog,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
and felt the damp of the river fog,anapaestic,10,34,8,swswswsws
that rises after the sun goes down,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswswsw
it was one by the village clock,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
when he galloped into lexington,anapaestic,10,31,5,swswswsws
he saw the gilded weathercock,anapaestic,10,29,5,wswswsws
swim in the moonlight as he passed,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
and the meeting house windows blank and bare,anapaestic,10,44,8,wswswswsws
gaze at him with a spectral glare,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
as if they already stood aghast,anapaestic,10,31,6,swswswsws
at the bloody work they would look upon,anapaestic,10,39,8,swsswswsws
it was two by the village clock,anapaestic,10,31,7,wswswsws
when he came to the bridge in concord town,anapaestic,10,42,9,wswswswsws
he heard the bleating of the flock,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
and the twitter of birds among the trees,anapaestic,10,40,8,swsswswsws
and felt the breath of the morning breeze,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
blowing over the meadows brown,anapaestic,10,30,5,swsswsws
and one was safe and asleep in his bed,anapaestic,10,38,9,swswswswsw
who at the bridge would be first to fall,anapaestic,10,40,9,swswswsws
who that day would be lying dead,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
pierced by a british musket ball,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
you know the rest in the books you have read,anapaestic,10,44,10,wswswswsws
how the british regulars fired and fled,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswsswswsw
how the farmers gave them ball for ball,anapaestic,10,39,8,swswswsws
from behind each fence and farm yard wall,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswswsws
chasing the red coats down the lane,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsw
then crossing the fields to emerge again,anapaestic,10,40,7,wswswswsws
under the trees at the turn of the road,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswswsw
and only pausing to fire and load,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswswsws
so through the night rode paul revere,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsws
and so through the night went his cry of alarm,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswwswswsws
to every middlesex village and farm,anapaestic,10,35,6,wsswswswsws
a cry of defiance and not of fear,anapaestic,10,33,8,swswswswsw
a voice in the darkness a knock at the door,anapaestic,10,43,10,wswwswswsws
and a word that shall echo forevermore,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsswsws
for borne on the night wind of the past,anapaestic,10,39,9,swswswsws
through all our history to the last,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswswsw
in the hour of darkness and peril and need,anapaestic,10,42,9,wwswswswswsw
the people will waken and listen to hear,anapaestic,10,40,8,wswswswswsw
the hurrying hoof beats of that steed,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswswsw
and the midnight message of paul revere,anapaestic,10,39,7,swswsswsws
does it matter losing your legs,anapaestic,10,31,6,wwswswsw
for people will always be kind,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
and you need not show that you mind,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
to gobble their muffins and eggs,anapaestic,10,32,6,wsswswsw
does it matter losing your sight,anapaestic,10,32,6,wwswswsw
there's such splendid work for the blind,anapaestic,10,40,7,wwswswsw
and people will always be kind,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
as you sit on the terrace remembering,anapaestic,10,37,7,wswswsswsws
and turning your face to the light,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
do they matter those dreams from the pit,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
you can drink and forget and be glad,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswswsw
and people won't say that you're mad,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
for they'll know you've fought for your country,anapaestic,10,47,8,wswswswsw
and no one will worry a bit,anapaestic,10,27,7,wswwswsw
o rose thou art sick,anapaestic,10,20,5,wswsw
the invisible worm,anapaestic,10,18,3,swswsw
that flies in the night,anapaestic,10,23,5,wswsw
in the howling storm,anapaestic,10,20,4,wwsws
has found out thy bed,anapaestic,10,21,5,wswsw
of crimson joy,anapaestic,10,14,3,wsws
and his dark secret love,anapaestic,10,24,5,wswsws
does thy life destroy,anapaestic,10,21,4,wwsws
the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,anapaestic,10,48,10,swsswswwswsw
and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold,anapaestic,10,48,9,wwswswswswsw
and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,anapaestic,10,55,12,wwswswswswsw
when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswswsws
like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswswwsw
that host with their banners at sunset were seen,anapaestic,10,48,9,swswsswswsw
like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswsswsw
that host on the morrow lay withered and strown,anapaestic,10,47,9,swswsswswsw
for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast,anapaestic,10,52,11,wwswswswswsw
and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed,anapaestic,10,48,11,wswswswswsw
and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,anapaestic,10,51,10,wswswswsswsw
and their hearts but once heaved and for ever grew still,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswswwswsw
and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswswswswsw
but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride,anapaestic,10,55,11,wswswswswsw
and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswsswswsw
and cold as the spray of the rock beating surf,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswwswswsws
and there lay the rider distorted and pale,anapaestic,10,42,8,swswsswswsw
with the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail,anapaestic,10,49,12,wswswswwswsw
and the tents were all silent the banners alone,anapaestic,10,47,9,wswswsswssws
the lances unlifted the trumpet unblown,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswswsw
autumn is wearing her bright golden crown,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswsws
for this morning shes coming to visit our town,anapaestic,10,46,9,wswswsswswsw
and wind her best friend will be joining her too,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswsw
will they have a nice day and just what will they do,anapaestic,10,52,12,wswswswswsww
shell be changing the colours of leaves on our trees,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswsswswsw
and wind likes to tease with his cold playful breeze,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswswssw
as the leaves tumble down in a pile on the ground,anapaestic,10,49,11,wswswswwswsw
he will take a deep breath and blow them around,anapaestic,10,47,10,wwswswswsws
they'll both knock down conkers for children to find,anapaestic,10,52,9,wswswswswsw
but the nuts arent just there for the good of mankind,anapaestic,10,53,11,wswsswswwswsw
the squirrels like nuts and theyll store them away,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswswswsw
but then out they will come on those cold wintry days,anapaestic,10,53,11,wwswwswswsws
so what do you think that the two friends might eat,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswswswswsw
what sorts of things would be good for a treat,anapaestic,10,46,10,wswswswsws
there are sweet tasting berries and fruits of all kinds,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswsswswsw
which are wonderful treats for the two friends to find,anapaestic,10,54,10,wwswswswswsw
they will chase over hills and along by the river,anapaestic,10,49,10,wswsswswswwsw
winds cold wintry breath may well cause us to shiver,anapaestic,10,52,10,swswswswswsw
the swallows will see them and say their goodbye,anapaestic,10,48,9,wsswswswsws
calling see you next year as they fly through the sky,anapaestic,10,53,11,swswwswwswsw
with the sun going down theres no time left to play,anapaestic,10,51,11,wswsswswswsw
but the two friends have had such a marvellous day,anapaestic,10,50,10,wswswswwswsw
when you look all around at this colourful scene,anapaestic,10,48,9,wswswswwswsw
you will see very clearly where these friends have been,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswswsww
the tiger stretches limb by limb,anapaestic,10,32,6,wswswsws
he views his world through sleepy eyes,anapaestic,10,38,7,wswswsws
and wonders what his day will bring,anapaestic,10,35,7,wswswsws
he does these things and so do i,anapaestic,10,32,8,wswswsws
the bear sets forth to hunt for food,anapaestic,10,36,8,wswswsws
and rambles under cloudy skies,anapaestic,10,30,5,wswswsws
he ponders what hell eat today,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswsws
he looks for food and so do i,anapaestic,10,29,8,wswswsws
all creatures teach their young to hunt,anapaestic,10,39,7,wswswsws
and watch for danger lest they die,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
the parents teach the skills of life,anapaestic,10,36,7,wswswsws
their young learn these and so do i,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
the creatures of the day will seek,anapaestic,10,34,7,wswswsws
a place to sleep thats warm and dry,anapaestic,10,35,8,wswswsws
a safe abode thats far from harm,anapaestic,10,32,7,wswswsws
they drift to sleep and so do i,anapaestic,10,31,8,wswswsws
the bull in the meadow was bellowing hard,anapaestic,10,41,8,swswsswswsw
with a bawling and blustering blare,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
but the cows thought the bull was just showing off,anapaestic,10,50,10,wwswswswsws
and continued to graze without care,anapaestic,10,35,6,swswswsws
his shouting his screaming his clamorous cry,anapaestic,10,44,7,wswswswswsw
continued by day and by night,anapaestic,10,29,6,wswswsws
his vociferous roaring soon got on their nerves,anapaestic,10,47,8,swsswswswsws
whilst the mice and the birds fled in fright,anapaestic,10,44,9,swswswsws
the farmer then noticed the terrible noise,anapaestic,10,42,7,wswswswswsw
and he called in the vet to the scene,anapaestic,10,37,9,swswswsws
the vet scratched his head and only could say,anapaestic,10,45,9,swswswswsw
its the noisiest bull that ive seen,anapaestic,10,35,7,swswswsws
i remember he lived at the farm up the road,anapaestic,10,43,10,swswswswswsw
and he had a particular friend,anapaestic,10,30,6,wswswswsw
i suggest that you buy her to go with your herd,anapaestic,10,47,11,swswwswwswsw
and im sure that his roaring will end,anapaestic,10,37,8,wswswswsw
so next week a new cow arrived in their field,anapaestic,10,45,10,wswswswswsw
shed been bought from the neighbouring farm,anapaestic,10,43,7,wswswswsw
shed endearing brown eyes and a beautiful face,anapaestic,10,46,8,swswswswswsw
was friendly and so full of charm,anapaestic,10,33,7,wswswsws
oh maisie my girlfriend the noisy bull said,anapaestic,10,43,8,wswswswswsw
how ive missed you since we said goodbye,anapaestic,10,40,8,swswswsws
it was obvious that maisie was pleased to see him,anapaestic,10,49,10,wwswswsswswsw
and mooed with delight in reply,anapaestic,10,31,6,wswswsws
now peace reigns supremely the pastures are quiet,anapaestic,10,49,8,swswswswswsws
theres birdsong and flowers in the spring,anapaestic,10,41,7,wswswswsws
and everyones happy especially the bull,anapaestic,10,39,6,wswswswswsw
yes loves truly a wonderful thing,anapaestic,10,33,6,swswswsws
there was a field in nazareth beside a joiner's yard,anapaestic,10,52,10,wswswswswswsws
a little donkey stood and sighed his life had been so hard,anapaestic,10,58,12,wswswswswswsws
im getting old and not much use for carrying heavy loads,anapaestic,10,56,11,wsswswwswsswssw
for trudging round the town all day on hot and dusty roads,anapaestic,10,58,12,wsswwswswswssw
his kindly master joseph said you mustnt worry now,anapaestic,10,50,9,wswswsswswsws
just spend your old age quietly wth bess our milking cow,anapaestic,10,56,11,wswswsswswswswswsw
so bess and he stayed in the field and watched the world go by,anapaestic,10,62,14,wswswswswswsws
when suddenly from heaven appeared an angel in the sky,anapaestic,10,54,10,wswswsswswswsws
theres one last job on earth for you a journey to be done,anapaestic,10,57,13,wswswswswswsws

weve chosen you to do this task especially for gods sake,anapaestic,10,56,11,wsswwswswsswsw
but i am old and useless the little donkey cried,anapaestic,10,48,10,wswswswswwsws
but there again id like the job for i feel quite young inside,anapaestic,10,61,13,wswswswswswswsw
the day arrived and off they set in sunshine warm and bright,anapaestic,10,60,12,wswswswswswsws
they travelled over dusty roads arriving before night,anapaestic,10,53,8,wswswswswsswsw
there were such a lot of people bethlehem was really packed,anapaestic,10,59,11,wswwswswswswsws
and many other donkeys came with loads upon their backs,anapaestic,10,55,10,wswswswswswsws
the only place they all could rest was in a stable warm,anapaestic,10,55,12,wswswwswswwssw
the little donkey stood nearby when jesus christ was born,anapaestic,10,57,10,wswswswswswsws
he went to sleep so happy im not useless after all,anapaestic,10,50,11,wswswswswswsws
he dreamed about an angel who came to his stable stall,anapaestic,10,54,11,wswswswswswsws

this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswswsw
bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight,dactyl,6,66,11,swswswswswswswsw
stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswsswswsw
stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswswwsw
darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswswsw
speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswswsw
this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswswsw
leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman,dactyl,6,75,15,wswswswswswswswsw
where is the thatch roofed village the home of acadian farmers,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswsswsw
men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,dactyl,6,62,11,wswsswwsswswssw
waste are those pleasant farms and the farmers forever departed,dactyl,6,63,10,wswswswswswsswsw
scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october,dactyl,6,64,11,swswswswsswswsw
seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean,dactyl,6,68,13,swswswswswswswsw
naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand pr,dactyl,6,65,11,wswsswswswswswswss
ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is patient,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswsswswswswwsw
ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswsswsw
list to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswswsw
list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happy,dactyl,6,50,12,swswswswswswwsw
in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas,dactyl,6,55,12,wswswswswswwsswsw
distant secluded still the little village of grand pr,dactyl,6,53,9,sswswswswswswss
lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswsswswswwsw
giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number,dactyl,6,64,11,sswsswswswswswsw
dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,dactyl,6,67,12,wswswswswswsswsw
shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood gates,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswswswswswsws
opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows,dactyl,6,62,12,swswswswswswswsw
west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswsws
spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain and away to the northward,dactyl,6,68,12,swswswswswswswwsw
blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains,dactyl,6,60,11,swswswswswswswsw
sea fogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswsswsw
looked on the happy valley but ne'er from their station descended,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswsswsw
there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswsswsw
strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of hemlock,dactyl,6,64,12,swswwswswswswsw
such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries,dactyl,6,66,13,wswsswswswswswwsw
thatched were the roofs with dormer windows and gables projecting,dactyl,6,65,10,wswswswswswswsw
over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway,dactyl,6,56,9,sswsswswswswswsw
there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswsws
lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,dactyl,6,63,11,sswswswswswswsw
matrons and maidens sat in snow white caps and in kirtles,dactyl,6,57,11,sswswswswswwsw
scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden,dactyl,6,60,10,swswswswswswsw
flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors,dactyl,6,62,10,wswsswswswsswsw
mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,dactyl,6,77,15,swswswswswswswwsw
solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children,dactyl,6,64,11,swswswswswswwsw
paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them,dactyl,6,63,13,swswswswswswsws
reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswwswsswsw
hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome,dactyl,6,60,9,sswswswswswswsw
then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank,dactyl,6,68,13,wswsswswswswswswsw
down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswsswswswwsw
softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswswsw
columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswswsw
rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswsws
thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers,dactyl,6,56,9,wswswswswswsswsw
dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from,dactyl,6,61,14,wswswswwswswsws
fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswsswswswswsw
neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,dactyl,6,63,12,swswswswswswsw
but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners,dactyl,6,65,13,wwsswsswswwswwsw
there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,dactyl,6,61,11,wwsswswwsswswsw
somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswwsswsswsswsw
benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grand pr,dactyl,6,56,8,swswwswswswswswss
dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsws
gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswwsw
stalwart and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswsswsw
hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswsswsw
white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak leaves,dactyl,6,74,16,wswswswswswswsws
fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswsswswsw
black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,dactyl,6,71,15,wswswwswswswswwsw
black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses,dactyl,6,72,13,wswswswswswswwsw
sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows,dactyl,6,67,14,wswswswswswswsw
when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswswwsswsw
flagons of home brewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden,dactyl,6,58,12,swswswswswswsw
fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswswswsw
sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswswsw
sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them,dactyl,6,59,8,wswswsswswsswsw
down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal,dactyl,6,72,14,wswswswwswswswsw
wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the ear rings,dactyl,6,63,13,sswswswwswswswsw
brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswwsw
handed down from mother to child through long generations,dactyl,6,57,9,swswswswswswsw
but a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty,dactyl,6,48,7,wswswswswswswsw
shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,dactyl,6,62,11,swswswswswswswsw
homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her,dactyl,6,60,9,wswswswswswswsws
when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswwswswswsw
firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswswswswwsw
stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady,dactyl,6,58,13,wswswwswswswswsw
sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswwswsswsw
rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath,dactyl,6,61,11,swswwswswswwsw
led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswwsw
under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswswwsw
such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswwsw
built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary,dactyl,6,58,13,wswswwswswsswsw
farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its moss grown,dactyl,6,70,15,swswswswswswswsw
bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses,dactyl,6,61,12,swsswswswswswwsw
shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard,dactyl,6,76,14,swswswswswswswsw
there stood the broad wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows,dactyl,6,75,13,wswswswswswswsw
there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswswswswsswsws
strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame,dactyl,6,64,11,sswswswswswswsw
voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswsswsw
bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one,dactyl,6,65,12,swswswswswswsws
far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase,dactyl,6,61,12,wswsswswswswswsw
under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswsswsw
there too the dove cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswwswsswsw
murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswwsswsw
numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation,dactyl,6,58,8,wswswswswwswswsw
thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grand pr,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswswss
lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household,dactyl,6,61,10,wswsswswswswswsw
many a youth as he knelt in church and opened his missal,dactyl,6,56,12,swswswswswsswsw
fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,dactyl,6,60,12,swswswswswswswsw
happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment,dactyl,6,63,14,swswswswswswswsw
many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended,dactyl,6,57,11,sswswswswswswsws
and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswswsw
knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswsswsw
or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswwswswwsw
bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswswsw
hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music,dactyl,6,53,11,swswswswswwsw
but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome,dactyl,6,53,10,wswswswswswswsw
gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,50,8,sswsswswsswsw
who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men,dactyl,6,58,13,wswswswwsswswsws
for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswsswsw
has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people,dactyl,6,60,13,wwswswswswswwsw
basil was benedict's friend their children from earliest childhood,dactyl,6,66,9,sswswswswswswsw
grew up together as brother and sister and father felician,dactyl,6,58,10,wswsswsswsswsswsw
priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters,dactyl,6,70,12,swswswswswswswsw
out of the self same book with the hymns of the church and the plain song,dactyl,6,73,16,wswswswswswswsws
but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswwswsswsw
swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,62,11,swswswswwswsswsw
there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswswsw
take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswsw
nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cart wheel,dactyl,6,71,15,swswswswswwswswsw
lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswswswswsws
oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness,dactyl,6,59,10,wswswswswswsswsw
bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice,dactyl,6,70,11,swswswsswsswsswsw
warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswsswsw
and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswwswswwsw
merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel,dactyl,6,61,11,sswswswswsswswsw
oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle,dactyl,6,59,13,swsswswswswswwsw
down the hillside bounding they glided away o'er the meadow,dactyl,6,59,10,wwswswwsswswwsw
oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswwswswswsw
seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswwsw
brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings,dactyl,6,71,14,wswswswswswswwsw
lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow,dactyl,6,60,13,swswswswswswwsw
thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswsws
he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning,dactyl,6,64,14,wswswswswswswwsw
gladdened the earth with its light and ripened thought into action,dactyl,6,66,11,swswswswsswswsw
she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman,dactyl,6,55,13,wswswswswswswsw
sunshine of saint eulalie' was she called for that was the sunshine,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswswswswsw
which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples,dactyl,6,67,11,wswswswswswswsw
she too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswwswswswsws
filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children,dactyl,6,52,10,sswwswwswsswsw
now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswswswswswsws
and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswswwswsw
birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the ice bound,dactyl,6,65,12,swswswwswswsws
desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,dactyl,6,56,9,sswswswwswsswsw
harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsw
wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel,dactyl,6,63,13,swswswswswswswwsw
all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement,dactyl,6,50,9,wwswswswswsww
bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswswswswsw
till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswwswswswsw
cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswswsw
such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswswsw
called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all saints,dactyl,6,61,11,wswsswsswsswswsws
filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswswsw
lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswsswswsswsw
peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswwsw
was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended,dactyl,6,60,11,wswsswswswswswsw
voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farm yards,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswswswsw
whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswswswsw
all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun,dactyl,6,65,14,wswswswwswswswsw
looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswwswsswsw
while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,dactyl,6,59,11,swswwswswswswsw
bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswwswswswswsw
flashed like the plane tree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels,dactyl,6,71,12,wswswswswswswsw
now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswswsw
day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswswsw
brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead,dactyl,6,71,14,wswswswswswswwsw
pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswswsw
and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening,dactyl,6,67,10,wswswswswsswsswsw
foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,dactyl,6,55,7,swsswswswswswsw
proud of her snow white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,dactyl,6,70,14,wswswswwswswswsw
quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection,dactyl,6,57,10,swswswswswswswsw
then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,dactyl,6,69,12,wswswswwswswwsw
where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watch dog,dactyl,6,67,11,wswswswswswswsws
patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct,dactyl,6,65,12,sswswswswswswwsw
walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly,dactyl,6,56,11,swswswswswswsws
waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers,dactyl,6,55,9,sswswswswswsws
regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector,dactyl,6,63,11,swswswswsswswsw
when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled,dactyl,6,74,13,wswswswswswswsws
late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswwsw
laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor,dactyl,6,54,11,sswswswswswwsw
cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,dactyl,6,70,12,swswswswswswswsw
while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,dactyl,6,63,10,swswswswsswswsw
painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson,dactyl,6,63,10,swswswswswsswsw
nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms,dactyl,6,58,9,sswswswswswswsw
patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders,dactyl,6,59,9,swswswswswswsw
unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence,dactyl,6,59,10,wswswswswwsswsw
into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended,dactyl,6,56,8,wswswswswswsws
lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm yard,dactyl,6,66,13,sswsswswswswswsw
echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness,dactyl,6,54,10,swswwswswswsws
heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barn doors,dactyl,6,64,12,swswswswswswsws
rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent,dactyl,6,55,11,sswswswswswswsw
in doors warm by the wide mouthed fireplace idly the farmer,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswswsw
sat in his elbow chair and watched how the flames and the smoke wreaths,dactyl,6,71,14,wswswswswswswsw
struggled together like foes in a burning city behind him,dactyl,6,57,10,sswswswswswsswsw
nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,dactyl,6,58,9,sswsswswswswsws
darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswsswsswswsws
faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm chair,dactyl,6,57,12,swswswswswswsws
laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswwsw
caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswsw
fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswsswsw
such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswwswswsswsw
sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards,dactyl,6,61,9,wswswswswswswsw
close at her father's side was the gentle evangeline seated,dactyl,6,59,10,wswswswswswswsws
spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her,dactyl,6,62,12,swswswswswswsws
silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,dactyl,6,64,11,sswswwswswswsswsw
while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswswswsw
followed the old man's song and united the fragments together,dactyl,6,61,10,swswswswswswswsw
as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswswswsw
footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,dactyl,6,69,14,swswswswswswswsw
so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswwswswswsws
thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswwswswsswsw
sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswswsw
benedict knew by the hob nailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,65,12,swswswswswwsswsw
and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswswsw
welcome' the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold,dactyl,6,72,11,swswswswwswswwsw
welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle,dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswswswsw
close by the chimney side which is always empty without thee,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswwswswsws
take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco,dactyl,6,60,12,swswswswswswswsw
never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling,dactyl,6,58,11,sswswswswswwsw
smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswswswswsws
round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes',dactyl,6,66,13,wwswwswswwswwsw
then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,63,11,wwswswswswsswsw
taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,dactyl,6,56,10,swswswswswswwsws
benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad,dactyl,6,61,10,swswwswswswswswsw
ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with,dactyl,6,62,11,sswswswswswswsws
gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them,dactyl,6,55,10,swswswswswswswsw
happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe',dactyl,6,64,13,swswswswswswswwsw
pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswswsws
and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswsswsswsw
four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswwsw
ride in the gaspereau's mouth with their cannon pointed against us,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswswswsws
what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswwswswwswsw
on the morrow to meet in the church where his majesty's mandate,dactyl,6,63,12,wwsswswwswwsswsw
will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswwswswsws
many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people',dactyl,6,53,10,sswswswswswswwsw
then made answer the farmer 'perhaps some friendlier purpose,dactyl,6,60,9,swswswswswswsw
brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswsws
by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,dactyl,6,55,9,wswswswswswswsw
and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children',dactyl,6,70,12,wswswswwswsswsw
not so thinketh the folk in the village' said warmly the blacksmith,dactyl,6,67,12,wwswswswswswswsw
shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswswswsw
louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sjour nor port royal,dactyl,6,56,10,swswswswswswswsw
many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts,dactyl,6,62,12,sswswswswswswswsw
waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to morrow,dactyl,6,57,10,sswswswswswswsw
arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswwswswsws
nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower',dactyl,6,72,13,swswswswswswswsw
then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswswsw
safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,dactyl,6,66,13,sswswswswswswsws
safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,dactyl,6,55,9,sswswswswswwsw
than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemy's cannon,dactyl,6,56,10,wwsswswswwsswsw
fear no evil my friend and to night may no shadow of sorrow,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswsswsw
fall on this house and earth for this is the night of the contract,dactyl,6,66,14,wswswswswswswsw
built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswwswswswwsw
strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them,dactyl,6,73,13,swswswswswswswsw
filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswswswwsws
ren leblanc will be here anon with his papers and ink horn,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswswwswsws
shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children',dactyl,6,65,14,wswwswswswswswsw
as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,dactyl,6,61,13,swswwswswswswwsw
blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,dactyl,6,62,10,sswswswswswsswsw
and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered,dactyl,6,54,11,wswswwswswsswsw
bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean,dactyl,6,60,13,wswswswswswswwsw
bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public,dactyl,6,60,13,wswswswswswwsswsw
shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung,dactyl,6,61,12,swsswswswswsws
over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows,dactyl,6,67,12,sswswswswswswsws
sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal,dactyl,6,54,11,swswswswswswsws
father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred,dactyl,6,56,11,sswswswswswswsw
children's children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswswswsw
four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,dactyl,6,67,14,wswswswswswswsws
suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswswswsw
now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion,dactyl,6,54,9,swswswswswswsw
ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswswsw
he was beloved by all and most of all by the children,dactyl,6,53,12,wswswwswwswwsw
for he told them tales of the loup garou in the forest,dactyl,6,54,12,wwswswswsswwsw
and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,dactyl,6,60,13,wswswswswswswsws
and of the white ltiche the ghost of a child who unchristened,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswsw
died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswsws
and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,dactyl,6,54,11,wswswswswswwsw
and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,dactyl,6,61,14,wswswswswswswswsw
and of the marvellous powers of four leaved clover and horseshoes,dactyl,6,65,11,wswsswsswswsswsw
with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswswswsw
then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,63,12,wwswwswwswsswsw
knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand,dactyl,6,67,12,wswswsswsswswsws
father leblanc' he exclaimed 'thou hast heard the talk in the village,dactyl,6,69,12,swswswswswswswsw
and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand',dactyl,6,70,13,swswswswswswwsw
then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,dactyl,6,55,9,wwsswswswswsswsw
gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,dactyl,6,58,12,sswswswswswsswsw
and what their errand may be i know not better than others,dactyl,6,58,12,wswsswswswsswsw
yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention,dactyl,6,53,11,wswswwswswswswsw
brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us',dactyl,6,60,13,wswwswwswwswsw
god's name' shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,dactyl,6,63,9,swsswswswswsswsw
must we in all things look for the how and the why and the where fore,dactyl,6,69,16,wswswswswswswsws
daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest',dactyl,6,64,12,sswswswswswswwsw
but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public,dactyl,6,58,9,swswswswsswsswsw
man is unjust but god is just and finally justice,dactyl,6,49,10,wswswswswsswsw
triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswswswsws
when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal',dactyl,6,61,14,wswswswswswswsws
this was the old man's favorite tale and he loved to repeat it,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswsswswswswsw
when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them,dactyl,6,62,10,wwsswswsswsswsw
once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswswsws
raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice,dactyl,6,51,10,swswwsswswsswsw
stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswswsw
and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided,dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswswswsswsw
over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people,dactyl,6,64,14,swswswswswswswsw
even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswswwsw
having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them,dactyl,6,67,13,swswswswswswswsw
but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswsw
might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty,dactyl,6,72,14,wswswswswswswwsw
ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a nobleman's palace,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswsswsw
that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion,dactyl,6,58,11,wwswswswswswswsw
fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswswsw
she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswsswswswwsw
patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice,dactyl,6,59,12,swswswswswwsswsw
as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,dactyl,6,55,10,wswsswsswsswsswsw
lo o'er the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder,dactyl,6,60,13,wswsswswswswswsw
smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswswsw
down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswsswswswswsw
and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswsswswswwsw
into whose clay built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven',dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswswsw
silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith,dactyl,6,66,11,sswswswwswswswsw
stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswsws
all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswwsw
freeze in fantastic shapes on the window panes in the winter,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswwswswwsw
then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,dactyl,6,52,9,swswswswswswwsw
filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with home brewed,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswsws
nut brown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grand pr,dactyl,6,72,15,wswswswswswswswss
while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink horn,dactyl,6,61,12,wswsswsswswswsws
wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,dactyl,6,60,13,wswswswswswswsw
naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle,dactyl,6,62,13,swswswswswswwsw
orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed,dactyl,6,61,10,swswswswsswswswsw
and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin,dactyl,6,62,15,wswswswswswswwsw
then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswwsw
three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswsws
and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,dactyl,6,63,11,wwsswsswsswswwsw
lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswswsw
wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswswswsw
while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,dactyl,6,57,11,wwsswswswswwsw
till evangeline brought the draught board out of its corner,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswswsw
soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswswsw
laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manuvre,dactyl,6,49,8,wswswswswswsws
laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the king row,dactyl,6,67,15,wswswswswswswsw
meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswwswswswswsw
sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise,dactyl,6,61,10,swsswsswsswswsws
over the pallid sea and the silvery mists of the meadows,dactyl,6,56,11,sswswswwswswswsw
silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven,dactyl,6,53,10,swswswswswswswsw
blossomed the lovely stars the forget me nots of the angels,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswswwsw
thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswwsw
rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway,dactyl,6,60,11,wswsswswswswsws
rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswsw
many a farewell word and sweet good night on the door step,dactyl,6,58,12,swswswswswswsw
lingered long in evangeline's heart and filled it with gladness,dactyl,6,63,10,wswswswswswswsw
carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth stone,dactyl,6,70,12,wswswsswswswswsw
and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswswsw
soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswswsw
up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,dactyl,6,55,10,wwswswswswwsw
lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden,dactyl,6,60,12,swswswswswswwsw
silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber,dactyl,6,62,12,sswswswswswswsw
simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes press,dactyl,6,72,13,wswswswwswswswsw
ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,dactyl,6,62,10,swswswswswswsws
linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven,dactyl,6,56,10,sswswswswswswsws
this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswswswswswsws
better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife,dactyl,6,69,13,swswswswswswswsw
soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,dactyl,6,67,11,wswswswswsswsswsw
streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,dactyl,6,78,14,wswswswswswswswsw
swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswswswswswswsw
ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswswswswsw
naked snow white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswwswswwsw
little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard,dactyl,6,60,11,swswswswswswwsw
waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow,dactyl,6,69,14,sswswswswswswswsw
yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswswsw
passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswwswswswwsw
flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment,dactyl,6,59,11,sswswswswswswsw
and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswswswsw
forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswwswswsswsw
as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswswsw
pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grand pr,dactyl,6,60,12,swswswswswswswss
pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswsswsw
where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor,dactyl,6,65,11,wwswwsswsswsswsw
life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswwsswsswsw
knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswwswswwsw
now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswswsswsw
came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswswswsswsw
many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk,dactyl,6,60,12,sswswsswswswsws
made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows,dactyl,6,60,11,swswswswswswsw
where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswswswswsw
group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswwsw
long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswsswswsswsw
thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors,dactyl,6,72,12,wswswswswswswsw
sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswsswsswsw
every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswswswswsws
for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswswswswsw
all things were held in common and what one had was another's,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswsw
yet under benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant,dactyl,6,58,8,wswswswswswswswsw
for evangeline stood among the guests of her father,dactyl,6,51,9,swswswswswswsw
bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswsws
fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswswsw
under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard,dactyl,6,52,11,wswswswwswswswsw
stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswsws
there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated,dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswswswwsswsw
there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,55,9,swswswsswsswsw
not far withdrawn from these by the cider press and the beehives,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswwswswwsw
michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats,dactyl,6,74,13,sswswswswwswswswsw
shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow white,dactyl,6,69,12,sswswswswswswsws
hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,dactyl,6,62,14,wswswswswswswwsws
glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers,dactyl,6,66,13,wswsswswswswswsw
gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,dactyl,6,57,12,swswswswswswwsw
tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunquerque,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswswswswsw
and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music,dactyl,6,53,11,swswwswswswwsw
merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,dactyl,6,57,9,swsswswswswsswsw
under the orchard trees and down the path to the meadows,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswswwsw
old folk and young together and children mingled among them,dactyl,6,59,10,wswswsswswswsws
fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedict's daughter,dactyl,6,59,9,swswswswswswswsw
noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith,dactyl,6,59,11,sswswswswswswsw
so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswswsws
sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat,dactyl,6,64,13,swswswsswsswswsws
thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard,dactyl,6,66,11,swswswswswswwsw
waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones,dactyl,6,68,13,sswswswswswswwsw
garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest,dactyl,6,62,10,sswswswswswswsw
then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswwswswswsws
entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswswswswsw
echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,dactyl,6,64,11,swswswswswswsws
echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal,dactyl,6,52,9,sswswswswswswsw
closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers,dactyl,6,64,12,wswsswswswswswsw
then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswswwsw
holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswsswsw
you are convened this day' he said 'by his majesty's orders,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswwsswsw
clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness,dactyl,6,67,13,swswswswswswswsw
let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswwswswswsw
painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous,dactyl,6,61,14,swswswswswswswsw
yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswswswsw
namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswsswswsws
forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswwsw
be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswsws
ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people,dactyl,6,54,9,sswswswswswswsws
prisoners now i declare you for such is his majesty's pleasure',dactyl,6,63,11,swswswswswswsswsw
as when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer,dactyl,6,54,11,wwswswswswswsws
suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones,dactyl,6,63,11,sswswswswswswwsw
beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswswwswsswsw
hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs,dactyl,6,70,12,sswswswswswswsw
bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures,dactyl,6,58,10,swswswswswswsw
so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswswswswswswsw
silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,dactyl,6,61,11,sswsswswswswsws
louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,dactyl,6,49,10,sswswsswswsswsw
and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswwsw
vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswswsw
rang through the house of prayer and high o'er the heads of the others,dactyl,6,70,14,wswswswswswswsw
rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,62,11,swswswswsswsswsw
as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows,dactyl,6,50,12,wswswswswswwsw
flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,dactyl,6,69,12,wswswswswswswswsw
down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswswsw
death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests',dactyl,6,72,13,wswswswswswswwsw
more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswswwswswswsw
smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswwsw
in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswswsw
lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician,dactyl,6,53,10,wswswswsswsswsw
entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswswswsw
raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence,dactyl,6,61,11,sswswswswswswswsw
all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people,dactyl,6,57,11,wwsswswswswwsw
deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswsswswsswsw
spake he as after the tocsin's alarum distinctly the clock strikes,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswsswswsws
what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswswsw
forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you,dactyl,6,62,13,swswswswsswswsws
not in word alone but in deed to love one another,dactyl,6,49,11,wwswswswswswsw
is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations,dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswswswswswsw
have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswsswswswswsw
this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it,dactyl,6,65,14,wswswswswswswsw
thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred,dactyl,6,58,9,swswswswswsswsw
lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswsswsw
see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswsswsw
hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them,dactyl,6,65,12,swswswswswsswsw
let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswwswswsswsw
let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them',dactyl,6,51,11,wswswswswsswsw
few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people,dactyl,6,65,14,wwswswswswswswsw
sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,dactyl,6,66,10,swswswswswswsswsw
while they repeated his prayer and said 'o father forgive them',dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswswsw
then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswswsw
fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,dactyl,6,69,13,swswswswswswswsws
not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswswswswswsw
sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated,dactyl,6,74,13,wswswwswswswsswsw
rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswsswswsw
meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides,dactyl,6,71,14,swswswsswswswswsw
wandered wailing from house to house the women and children,dactyl,6,59,10,swsswswswsswsw
long at her father's door evangeline stood with her right hand,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsw
shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending,dactyl,6,65,12,swswswswswswswsw
lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each,dactyl,6,67,10,sswsswswsswswsws
peasant's cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows,dactyl,6,63,9,swswswswswsswsw
long within had been spread the snow white cloth on the table,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswswsw
there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wild flowers,dactyl,6,69,12,wswswswwswswswsw
there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy,dactyl,6,74,14,wswswswswswswwsw
and at the head of the board the great arm chair of the farmer,dactyl,6,62,14,wswswswswswswsw
thus did evangeline wait at her father's door as the sunset,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswswwsw
threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswsw
ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,dactyl,6,50,10,wswsswswswsswsw
and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswwswswswswsw
charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience,dactyl,6,59,9,sswswswswswswsw
then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswswsw
cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,dactyl,6,62,11,sswswswswswwsw
as o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,dactyl,6,63,10,wswswswswswswsw
urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children,dactyl,6,67,12,wswswswwswswwsw
down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswwswsswsw
veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai,dactyl,6,67,12,wswswswwswswswsw
sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded,dactyl,6,56,10,swsswswswswswsws
meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered,dactyl,6,58,9,wswswswwswswsws
all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows,dactyl,6,61,13,wwsswswwswwswwsw
stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion,dactyl,6,58,10,wswsswswswswsws
gabriel' cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswswswsw
came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living,dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswswswswswsw
slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswwswswswsw
smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswswswswswsswsw
empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswswswsw
sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber,dactyl,6,63,13,swswswswswswswsw
in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall,dactyl,6,61,12,wwswswswswswsws
loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore tree by the window,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswwswswswsw
keenly the lightning flashed and governed the voice of the echoing thunder,dactyl,6,74,12,wswswswswswswsswsw
told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswwsswswswswsw
then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswwsswsw
soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning,dactyl,6,71,11,wswsswswswswswsw
four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day,dactyl,6,61,14,wswswswswswswsw
cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse,dactyl,6,63,11,swswswswwswswwsw
soon o'er the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswswsw
came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women,dactyl,6,61,10,wswsswswswswsswsw
driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea shore,dactyl,6,65,11,sswswswswswsws
pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswwsw
ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswwswswwsw
close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswwsw
while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings,dactyl,6,69,11,wswswswswswsws
thus to the gaspereau's mouth they hurried and there on the sea beach,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswswsws
piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswwsw
all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply,dactyl,6,62,13,swswswswswswsw
all day long the wains came laboring down from the village,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswswswswsw
late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswswswswsw
echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard,dactyl,6,69,13,swswswswswswwsw
thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the church doors,dactyl,6,68,12,sswsswswswwswsws
opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession,dactyl,6,65,11,swswswswswswswsw
followed the long imprisoned but patient acadian farmers,dactyl,6,56,8,sswswsswsswsswsw
even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswswsw
sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswwswswswsswsw
so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended,dactyl,6,58,10,wwswswswsswsswsw
down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswwswswswwsw
foremost the young men came and raising together their voices,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswsswsswsw
sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions,dactyl,6,57,10,swswswswswswsw
sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain,dactyl,6,52,8,swswwswswswswsw
fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience',dactyl,6,67,11,wswswswswsswsw
then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,dactyl,6,72,15,wswswswswswswswsw
joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswswsws
mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed,dactyl,6,61,9,wswswswsswsswsw
half way down to the shore evangeline waited in silence,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswswswswsw
not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswwswswsw
calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her,dactyl,6,63,10,swswswswswswsswsw
and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion,dactyl,6,52,10,wswswswswswswsw
tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswsws
clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswswsw
gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another,dactyl,6,51,11,swswswswwswswsw
nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen',dactyl,6,60,10,swswswswswswswsw
smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father,dactyl,6,65,11,sswswswswswswsw
saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect,dactyl,6,56,10,swswswswswswwsw
gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep,dactyl,6,75,16,wswswswswswswswwsw
heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom,dactyl,6,62,12,swswswswwswswwsw
but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him,dactyl,6,65,14,wswswswswswswsw
speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not,dactyl,6,63,10,wswswswswswswsw
thus to the gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession,dactyl,6,63,10,wswswswswswswsw
there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswwswswswsw
busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,dactyl,6,53,9,sswswswswwswsw
wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,dactyl,6,75,13,wswswswswwswswsw
left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswswsw
so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried,dactyl,6,53,9,wswsswswsswsswsw
while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswwswswswswsw
half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight,dactyl,6,66,14,wswswswswswswsw
deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean,dactyl,6,60,10,swswswswswswswsw
fled away from the shore and left the line of the sand beach,dactyl,6,60,13,swswswswswswsw
covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery sea weed,dactyl,6,66,13,swswswswswwswsws
farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,dactyl,6,63,12,swswswswswswwsw
like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle,dactyl,6,48,11,wswswswwswswsws
all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them,dactyl,6,57,12,swswswswswswsws
lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers,dactyl,6,56,9,swswwswsswsswsw
back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dactyl,6,58,9,wswswswswswsswsw
dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,dactyl,6,57,9,sswswswswsswsw
inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswswwsw
then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswswswsw
sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders,dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswwswswswsw
lowing they waited and long at the well known bars of the farm yard,dactyl,6,67,14,sswswswswswswsws
waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk maid,dactyl,6,69,15,swswswswswswswsw
silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded,dactyl,6,65,11,swswswswswswsws
rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswwsw
but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,dactyl,6,62,11,wwswswsswsswwsw
built of the drift wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest,dactyl,6,70,14,wswswswswswswsw
round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,dactyl,6,60,10,wwswswsswsswsw
voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children,dactyl,6,64,13,sswswswswswwsswsw
onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,dactyl,6,63,13,wswsswswswswswwsw
wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,dactyl,6,64,9,wswswswsswsswsw
like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea shore,dactyl,6,57,9,wswsswswswswsws
thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswsswswswsw
and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,dactyl,6,58,12,wswsswswswswsws
haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion,dactyl,6,64,11,sswswswswswswswsw
e'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken,dactyl,6,64,14,swswswswswswswsw
vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswswsws
vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,dactyl,6,67,14,swswswswswswswsw
but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight,dactyl,6,62,11,wswsswsswswsswsws
benedicite' murmured the priest in tones of compassion,dactyl,6,54,8,wswsswswswswsw
more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,dactyl,6,67,14,wwswwswwswswwsw
faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold,dactyl,6,69,15,swswswswswswswwsw
hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow,dactyl,6,63,12,swswswswwswsswsw
silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,dactyl,6,61,12,sswswswswswswwsw
raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,dactyl,6,60,11,sswswswwsswswsw
moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswwswsswsw
then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswsswsw
suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the blood red,dactyl,6,63,13,swswswswswwswsws
moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and o'er the horizon,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswsw
titan like stretches its hundred hands upon the mountain and meadow,dactyl,6,67,11,sswsswswswswswsws
seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together,dactyl,6,65,11,swswswsswsswsswsw
broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswwsw
gleamed on the sky and sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead,dactyl,6,66,14,wswswswswswswsw
columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were,dactyl,6,57,10,sswsswsswsswsw
thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr,dactyl,6,77,13,wswswswswswswswsw
then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,dactyl,6,71,13,wswswswswswswssw
whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house tops,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswsw
started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled,dactyl,6,60,9,wswswswswswswsw
these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswswwsw
speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswwsw
we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grand pr',dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswwswswss
loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm yards,dactyl,6,58,13,wswsswswswswsws
thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswswsswsw
came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswwswswswsw
then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswwswswswsw
far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswsswswswswsw
when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,dactyl,6,72,13,wswswswswswswswsw
or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river,dactyl,6,58,11,wswsswswswswswsw
such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses,dactyl,6,70,15,wwswswswswswswwsw
broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed o'er the meadows,dactyl,6,70,12,wswswswswswswsw
overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden,dactyl,6,67,11,swswwswswswswsw
gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswsswsswsswsw
and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswwsswsw
lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the sea shore,dactyl,6,68,14,wswswwsswswswsws
motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed,dactyl,6,56,10,swswswswswswsw
slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswswwsw
knelt at her father's side and wailed aloud in her terror,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswwsw
then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom,dactyl,6,59,14,wswswswswswswsw
through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswsswsw
and when she awoke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her,dactyl,6,66,13,wwswswswswswswsws
faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her,dactyl,6,64,11,swswswswswswsswsw
pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion,dactyl,6,56,9,sswswswswsswsw
still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswswswswswsw
reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswswwsswsw
and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswwsswsw
then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswswswswswsw
let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season,dactyl,6,53,12,swsswswswswsswsw
brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswwswswswswsw
then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the church yard',dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswswsw
such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the sea side,dactyl,6,68,15,wswswswswswswsw
having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswswswsw
but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grand pr,dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswsswswswss
and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswwswswswswsw
lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswwswswswsw
solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges,dactyl,6,62,11,swswswswswswswsw
twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswwsw
with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswwswswswswsw
then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswsws
and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,dactyl,6,63,14,wswswswswswswsw
leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswswswwsswsw
many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand pr,dactyl,6,58,12,sswsswswswswswss
when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,dactyl,6,55,9,wswswswswsswsw
bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile,dactyl,6,55,10,sswsswswswswsws
exile without an end and without an example in story,dactyl,6,52,10,swswswswswswswsw
far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,dactyl,6,50,8,wswswswswswsswsw
scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,dactyl,6,72,13,swswswswswswsws
strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland,dactyl,6,69,11,swswswswswswsws
friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city,dactyl,6,60,9,swswswswswsswsw
from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswwswswsswsw
from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters,dactyl,6,72,15,wswswwswswswsswsw
seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean,dactyl,6,62,13,swswswswswswwsw
deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswsswswswwsw
friends they sought and homes and many despairing heart broken,dactyl,6,62,10,swswswsswsswsw
asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside,dactyl,6,68,15,wswswswswswswswsws
written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards,dactyl,6,67,11,sswsswswswswswsw
long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,dactyl,6,57,11,swswwswsswsswsw
lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things,dactyl,6,59,10,sswswsswsswswsws
fair was she and young but alas before her extended,dactyl,6,51,10,wswswswswswsws
dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway,dactyl,6,62,12,sswswsswswswswsw
marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswwswsswsswsw
passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned,dactyl,6,60,9,swswswswswswsw
as the emigrant's way o'er the western desert is marked by,dactyl,6,58,11,wwsswswwswsswsw
camp fires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswwsw
something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished,dactyl,6,63,9,swswwswswswswsws
as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine,dactyl,6,55,12,wswswswswswswsw
suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended,dactyl,6,54,9,swswswswswsswsw
into the east again from whence it late had arisen,dactyl,6,50,10,wswswswwswswsw
sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswswswswswsws
urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswwsw
she would commence again her endless search and endeavor,dactyl,6,56,9,wswswswswswsws
sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,dactyl,6,72,11,wswswswswswswsw
sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswswsw
he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him,dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswswswswsws
sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper,dactyl,6,51,8,wswswswswswsswsw
came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswsswsw
sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswswsw
but it was long ago in some far off place or forgotten,dactyl,6,54,12,wswswswswswswsw
gabriel lajeunesse' they said 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl,6,54,10,sswsswswswwsw
he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies,dactyl,6,67,13,wswsswswswswswsw
coureurs des bois are they and famous hunters and trappers',dactyl,6,59,10,wswswswswswsws
gabriel lajeunesse' said others 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl,6,56,10,sswsswsswswwsw
he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana',dactyl,6,46,9,wswswswwswswswsw
then would they say 'dear child why dream and wait for him longer,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswswswswwsw
are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others,dactyl,6,52,10,wswswswswsswsw
who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal,dactyl,6,55,11,wwswswswwsswsw
here is baptiste leblanc the notary's son who has loved thee,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswsw
many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy,dactyl,6,55,12,sswswswswswswwsw
thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherine's tresses',dactyl,6,61,12,wswswwswswswsw
then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly 'i cannot,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswswswswswsws
whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere,dactyl,6,65,12,sswswswswswswsw
for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway,dactyl,6,68,13,wwswswswswswswsws
many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness',dactyl,6,60,11,sswswswswsswsw
thereupon the priest her friend and father confessor,dactyl,6,52,8,swswswswsswsw
said with a smile 'o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswsw
talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted,dactyl,6,55,9,wswsswswwswsswsw
if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswswswsw
back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment,dactyl,6,71,13,wswswswswswswsw
that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswsswswwsw
patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection,dactyl,6,62,9,swswswsswswswswsw
sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike,dactyl,6,62,10,sswsswswswswswsw
therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike,dactyl,6,69,12,swswswsswswswswsw
purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven',dactyl,6,67,9,swswswswswswswsw
cheered by the good man's words evangeline labored and waited,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswswsw
still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswswswswsw
but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered 'despair not',dactyl,6,73,13,wswswswswswsswsw
thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswwswsw
bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence,dactyl,6,59,9,swsswswswswswsw
let me essay o muse to follow the wanderer's footsteps,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswswswswsw
not through each devious path each changeful year of existence,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswswswswswsw
but as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley,dactyl,6,66,11,wswsswsswswswwsw
far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswswwsw
here and there in some open space and at intervals only,dactyl,6,55,11,wwswwsswswswssw
then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it,dactyl,6,67,11,wswswswswswswsw
though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswsswsw
happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet,dactyl,6,62,13,swswswswswswswsw
it was the month of may far down the beautiful river,dactyl,6,52,11,wswswwswwswsww
past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash,dactyl,6,52,11,wswswswswswwsw
into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswswsw
floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen,dactyl,6,57,10,sswswswswswsswsw
it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked,dactyl,6,62,14,wswswswswswswwsw
nation scattered along the coast now floating together,dactyl,6,54,8,swsswswswsswsw
bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswwsswswwsswsw
men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay,dactyl,6,59,12,swswswswswswswsw
sought for their kith and their kin among the few acred farmers,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswwswswwswsw
on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswswswswsws
with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician,dactyl,6,59,10,wswswswswswsswsw
onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests,dactyl,6,65,10,wswswswwswswswsw
day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,dactyl,6,51,9,wswswsswswswsws
night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswwswsswswwsw
now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike,dactyl,6,62,9,swswswswsswsw
cotton trees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current,dactyl,6,68,11,sswsswswswswswsw
then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sand bars,dactyl,6,55,9,wswswswswswsws
lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin,dactyl,6,62,12,swswswswswswwsw
shining with snow white plumes large flocks of pelicans waded,dactyl,6,61,10,sswswswswsswsw
level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswswswswwsw
shaded by china trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,dactyl,6,55,10,sswswswswswswsw
stood the houses of planters with negro cabins and dove cots,dactyl,6,60,11,swswswswswswsws
they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,dactyl,6,62,9,wswswswswswsswsw
where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswsws
sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswsswswwsw
they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,dactyl,6,71,12,wswswswswswsswsws
soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswsswswsw
which like a network of steel extended in every direction,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswswswsw
over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,dactyl,6,65,11,sswswswswswswswsw
met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid air,dactyl,6,50,11,wswswswswswsws
waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals,dactyl,6,63,11,swswswswswswsws
deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,dactyl,6,60,10,wswsswswswswwsw
home to their roosts in the cedar trees returning at sunset,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswwswswswsws
or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,dactyl,6,59,12,wwswswswswswswsws
lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswsw
gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,dactyl,6,65,11,wswsswswswswsswsw
down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswsw
dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them,dactyl,6,64,10,wswswswswwswsw
and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,dactyl,6,65,12,wswsswswswswswsw
strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswswswswswsw
as at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,dactyl,6,61,14,wswswwswswswswsw
far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswsw
so at the hoof beats of fate with sad forebodings of evil,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswswswsw
shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it,dactyl,6,67,13,swsswswswswswsw
but evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision that faintly,dactyl,6,61,10,swswswswswwsswsw
floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight,dactyl,6,65,11,sswswswswswswsw
it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom,dactyl,6,67,14,wswswswswswswwsw
through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her,dactyl,6,60,9,wwsswswsswswssw
and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswsswsw
then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,dactyl,6,65,15,wswswswswswswwsw
and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswswswswsw
sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswswwsw
wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,dactyl,6,67,11,swswswswswswswsw
breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest,dactyl,6,61,11,sswswsswswswwsw
soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswwswswswswsw
multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,dactyl,6,51,8,swswswswswswwsw
over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches,dactyl,6,58,9,sswswswswswswswsw
but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswswwsw
and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence,dactyl,6,67,14,wswswswswswswwsw
then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,dactyl,6,64,10,swswswswswswwsw
silent at times then singing familiar canadian boat songs,dactyl,6,57,9,sswswswswswswsws
such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers,dactyl,6,52,11,wswswswwswsswsw
while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,dactyl,6,70,12,wwswswswswswswsw
far offindistinctas of wave or wind in the forest,dactyl,6,49,9,wswswswswswwsw
mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator,dactyl,6,68,14,wswswswswswswswsw
thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them,dactyl,6,66,12,wswsswswswswswsw
lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya,dactyl,6,50,10,wswswswswwswsws
water lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations,dactyl,6,56,9,swsswswswswsswsw
made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus,dactyl,6,60,11,wswsswswswswswsw
lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswswswwsw
faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswwswswswswsw
and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswswsswsw
fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,dactyl,6,62,9,sswsswsswsswsswsw
near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswsswswsswsw
soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswwsswswsw
under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswswswsw
safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward,dactyl,6,66,11,sswswswsswswwsw
tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered,dactyl,6,61,9,wswswswswsswsw
over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar,dactyl,6,52,11,sswswswswswswsw
swinging from its great arms the trumpet flower and the grapevine,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswsw
hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob,dactyl,6,57,11,swsswswswwsswsw
on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending,dactyl,6,57,8,wswswswswswswsw
were the swift humming birds that flitted from blossom to blossom,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswsswsswsw
such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it,dactyl,6,62,11,wswsswswswswswsws
filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswswwswwssw
lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswswswswsw
nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands,dactyl,6,51,8,sswswsswswswsws
darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswwsw
urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswwswswswswsw
northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswwsswsw
at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswsw
dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswwswswswsw
somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswwswsswsw
gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless,dactyl,6,58,10,swswswsswsswsswsw
sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswswwsw
swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island,dactyl,6,59,11,wswsswswswswswsw
but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswswsws
so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows,dactyl,6,67,14,wswswswswswswwsw
all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswwswswswswwsw
angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswsswswsw
swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie,dactyl,6,65,13,wswsswswswswswwsw
after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,dactyl,6,68,14,swswswswswswswsw
as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswswswsw
said with a sigh to the friendly priest 'o father felician,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswwswswsswsw
something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders,dactyl,6,55,10,swswwswswsswsw
is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition,dactyl,6,52,10,wswswswswswswsw
or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit',dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswswswswsw
then with a blush she added 'alas for my credulous fancy,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswsswswswswsw
unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning',dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswwswsw
but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswsswswswswsw
daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning,dactyl,6,66,13,swswswswswswswsws
feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface,dactyl,6,65,13,swswswswswswwsw
is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswswswsw
therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions,dactyl,6,66,12,swswwswswswswsw
gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward,dactyl,6,60,12,sswswswswwswswwsw
on the banks of the tche are the towns of st maur and st martin,dactyl,6,63,15,wswswswswswswswsw
there the long wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,dactyl,6,69,12,wswswswswsswswwsw
there the long absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswsswswswwsw
beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit trees,dactyl,6,66,12,swswswswsswswsws
under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswswswswsw
bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswwsw
they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana',dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswwswswswsw
with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswsw
softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswwsswsw
like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape,dactyl,6,59,10,wswswswswswswwsw
twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest,dactyl,6,51,9,wswsswswswswsws
seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswswsw
hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswswsswsw
floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water,dactyl,6,63,11,swswswswswwsswsw
filled was evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness,dactyl,6,58,7,wswswswswwsswsw
touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswsws
glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswswswswswsw
then from a neighboring thicket the mocking bird wildest of singers,dactyl,6,67,11,wswsswsswswswswsw
swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswwswswswwsw
shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,dactyl,6,59,10,wswsswswswsswsw
that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen,dactyl,6,70,14,wswswswswswsswsw
plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness,dactyl,6,65,12,swswswswswswsws
seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes,dactyl,6,63,11,wswsswswswswswsw
single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswswswswsw
till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsws
as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops,dactyl,6,58,13,wwswswswswswsw
shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswwswswswsw
with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswswsw
slowly they entered the tche where it flows through the green opelousas,dactyl,6,71,12,sswswswwswswswsws
and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswwsw
saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling,dactyl,6,62,11,swswswswswwsswsw
sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswwswsswsw
near to the bank of the river o'ershadowed by oaks from whose branches,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswwswswswswwsw
garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,dactyl,6,57,9,sswswswwswswsws
such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswwswsswsw
stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswsswsw
girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,dactyl,6,55,10,sswswswswswswsw
filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers,dactyl,6,62,11,sswswsswswswwsw
hewn from the cypress tree and carefully fitted together,dactyl,6,56,9,wswswswswswswsw
large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswwswsswsw
rose wreathed vine encircled a broad and spacious veranda,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswswsswsw
haunt of the humming bird and the bee extended around it,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswswswsw
at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,dactyl,6,55,12,wwswwswswsswwsw
stationed the dove cots were as love's perpetual symbol,dactyl,6,55,9,swswswwswsswsw
scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals,dactyl,6,58,9,swswswswswswsws
silence reigned o'er the place the line of shadow and sunshine,dactyl,6,62,11,swswwswswsswsw
ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow,dactyl,6,65,14,wswswswswswswwsw
and from its chimney top ascending and slowly expanding,dactyl,6,55,9,wswswswswswswsw
into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose,dactyl,6,53,11,wswswswswswsws
in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,dactyl,6,59,13,wwswwswwswswsww
through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,dactyl,6,70,13,wswswswswswsswsw
into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswsswswsswsw
full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswsswsw
hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,dactyl,6,66,12,swswswswswswswsw
stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grape vines,dactyl,6,60,11,swsswswswswsws
just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswsw
mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups,dactyl,6,55,9,wswswswswsswsw
sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin,dactyl,6,57,10,swsswswsswsswsw
broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswsswsw
gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswwswswwsw
round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing,dactyl,6,63,11,swswwswswswswsw
quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness,dactyl,6,57,9,swswwswswswsswsw
that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswsswsw
slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding,dactyl,6,59,11,swswswswswswsws
fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded,dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswswswsw
wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening,dactyl,6,66,13,swswswswswswwsw
suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle,dactyl,6,60,12,swswswswswswwsw
rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswsws
silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,dactyl,6,65,11,sswsswswswswswsw
and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswswwsw
then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden,dactyl,6,71,14,wswswswswswswwsw
saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him,dactyl,6,67,14,wswswswswsswswsws
suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward,dactyl,6,63,11,swswswswswswswsw
rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder,dactyl,6,52,8,wswswswswsswsw
when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswswswswswsw
hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswswswsw
there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswswsws
gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces,dactyl,6,66,11,swswswswswswsws
laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful,dactyl,6,62,10,swswswswswsswsw
thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings,dactyl,6,66,11,wswsswswswswswsw
stole o'er the maiden's heart and basil somewhat embarrassed,dactyl,6,60,9,wswswswsswswsw
broke the silence and said 'if you came by the atchafalaya,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswswswwswsws
how have you nowhere encountered my gabriel's boat on the bayous',dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswswsw
over evangeline's face at the words of basil a shade passed,dactyl,6,59,11,sswswswswswswsws
tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswsws
gone is gabriel gone' and concealing her face on his shoulder,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswswswswsw
all her o'erburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswswsw
then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswswsw
be of good cheer my child it is only to day he departed,dactyl,6,55,13,wswswswwswswswsw
foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses,dactyl,6,60,13,swswswswswswswsw
moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswsswsw
could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswswwsswsw
thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever,dactyl,6,50,8,swswswswswsswsw
ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles,dactyl,6,53,10,swsswswswswswsw
he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswswswswswwsw
tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswswsw
unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswswwsw
thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains,dactyl,6,62,11,wswsswswswswswsw
hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver,dactyl,6,61,11,swswswswswwsswsw
therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover,dactyl,6,60,11,swswswswswswswsw
he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him,dactyl,6,70,16,wswswswswswswswsw
up and away to morrow and through the red dew of the morning,dactyl,6,60,13,wswswswswswswwsw
we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison',dactyl,6,57,12,wwsswswswswwsw
then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river,dactyl,6,62,13,swswswswswswwsw
borne aloft on his comrades' arms came michael the fiddler,dactyl,6,58,10,swswwswswsswsws
long under basil's roof had he lived like a god on olympus,dactyl,6,58,12,wswsswswswswswsw
having no other care than dispensing music to mortals,dactyl,6,53,9,sswsswswswswsws
far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle,dactyl,6,55,11,swswswwswswwsw
long live michael' they cried 'our brave acadian minstrel',dactyl,6,58,9,swsswswswsswsw
as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswswswswsswsw
father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man,dactyl,6,61,9,sswswswswswswswsw
kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured,dactyl,6,60,10,swswswswswswswsw
hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,dactyl,6,56,9,wswsswswswsswsw
laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters,dactyl,6,58,9,sswswswswsswsw
much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci devant blacksmith,dactyl,6,65,12,wwsswswswwswssw
all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor,dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswswswsws
much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,dactyl,6,65,13,wwsswswswwswwsw
and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them,dactyl,6,71,13,wswsswswswswswsw
each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise,dactyl,6,66,14,wwswwswwswswwsw
thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswswswswsws
entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswsswsswsw
waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,dactyl,6,59,10,sswswswwswswswsw
over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended,dactyl,6,51,8,sswswswswswsws
all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,dactyl,6,61,10,wwswswswswswswsw
fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswwswswswsw
brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight,dactyl,6,74,12,swswswswswswsswsw
then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman,dactyl,6,65,13,wswsswswswswsswsw
poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswwswswswswsw
lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco,dactyl,6,65,10,sswswswswswsswsw
thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened,dactyl,6,68,13,wswswswswswswsw
welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless,dactyl,6,71,12,swswswswswswsws
welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one,dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswswsswswsws
here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers,dactyl,6,56,10,swswswswswswsw
here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer,dactyl,6,53,10,swswswswswwsw
smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water,dactyl,6,74,13,wswswswswswswwsw
all the year round the orange groves are in blossom and grass grows,dactyl,6,67,13,wwswwswswwsswsw
more in a single night than a whole canadian summer,dactyl,6,51,10,wswswswwswsswsw
here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,dactyl,6,64,11,swswswswswswwsw
here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswwswswswsw
with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswswsw
after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswsswsw
no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswswswwsw
burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle',dactyl,6,73,12,wswsswswswswswsw
speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswwsw
while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table,dactyl,6,59,11,wwswswswswwsw
so that the guests all started and father felician astounded,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswswswsswsw
suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff half way to his nostrils,dactyl,6,62,12,swswswswswswwsw
but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer,dactyl,6,63,12,wswsswswwswswsw
only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswswwsw
for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate,dactyl,6,51,11,wwswwswwswsswsw
cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell',dactyl,6,62,12,swsswswswswswsw
then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswswswsw
sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswswsws
it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters,dactyl,6,57,9,wswswswswswsswsw
who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswwswsswsw
merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors,dactyl,6,55,9,sswswswswswsws
friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers,dactyl,6,71,13,wswswswwswswwsw
meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other,dactyl,6,60,10,wswswswswswswsw
drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together,dactyl,6,53,10,wswswswwswswsws
but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswswsw
from the accordant strings of michael's melodious fiddle,dactyl,6,56,8,wswswswsswsswsw
broke up all further speech away like children delighted,dactyl,6,56,9,wswswswswswsws
all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening,dactyl,6,65,10,wswsswswswswwsws
whirl of the giddy dance as it swept and swayed to the music,dactyl,6,60,13,wswswswswswswsw
dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments,dactyl,6,63,10,wswswswwswsswsw
meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswswwsw
sat conversing together of past and present and future,dactyl,6,54,9,wswswsswswsswsw
while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her,dactyl,6,56,9,swswswswswswsw
olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music,dactyl,6,54,11,swswswswswswwsw
heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswsswsw
came o'er her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswswswswswsw
beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest,dactyl,6,59,11,swswwswswswswsw
tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river,dactyl,6,58,11,sswswswswswswwsw
fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,dactyl,6,75,13,wswswswswswswswsw
like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswwswswswsw
nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,dactyl,6,61,11,sswswswwswswswsw
poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,dactyl,6,71,12,wswswswswswswsw
unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswswswsswsws
fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews,dactyl,6,69,12,sswswswswsswsswsw
hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswsswsw
seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,dactyl,6,53,8,swswswswswsswsw
as through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the oak trees,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswswswswswsw
passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswsswsw
silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and fire flies,dactyl,6,56,12,swswswswswswswsws
gleamed and floated away in mingled and infinite numbers,dactyl,6,56,9,swsswswswswswsw
over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens,dactyl,6,58,12,swswswswswswsw
shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswsw
save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswsswswswswsw
as if a hand had appeared and written upon them 'upharsin',dactyl,6,58,11,wwswswswswswswsw
and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire flies,dactyl,6,63,13,wwswwsswswswwssw
wandered alone and she cried 'o gabriel o my beloved,dactyl,6,52,10,wswswwswswswsws
art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee,dactyl,6,53,12,wswwswswswsswsw
art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me,dactyl,6,60,14,wswwswswswswsws
ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie,dactyl,6,56,12,wwswswswswswsw
ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me,dactyl,6,62,12,wwswswswswswsws
ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor,dactyl,6,50,9,wwswsswswswsww
thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers,dactyl,6,62,14,wwswwswwswswwsw
when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee',dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswsws
loud and sudden and near the notes of a whippoorwill sounded,dactyl,6,60,11,swswswswswswsws
like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,dactyl,6,67,12,wwswswswswwsswsw
farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence,dactyl,6,60,10,swswswswswswswsw
patience' whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,dactyl,6,62,9,swswswswsswsswsw
and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded 'to morrow',dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswswsw
bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswswsw
bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,dactyl,6,65,11,swswswswswswsws
with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswsswsw
farewell' said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswwsswsw
see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswwswswswsswsw
and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming',dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswsws
farewell' answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,dactyl,6,62,9,wswswsswsswsswsw
down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswsswsw
thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,dactyl,6,67,10,swswswswswswswsw
swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswsws
blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswwswsswsw
not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded,dactyl,6,56,12,wwswwswwswswsw
found they the trace of his course in lake or forest or river,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswsw
nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain,dactyl,6,62,12,wswsswswswswswsw
rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswswsswsw
till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes,dactyl,6,52,11,wswswswwsswsws
weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord,dactyl,6,68,11,swswswswswswsswsw
that on the day before with horses and guides and companions,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswsw
gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies,dactyl,6,58,11,sswswswswswswsw
far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswsswswsw
lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits,dactyl,6,61,9,wswsswswswswswsw
down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,dactyl,6,66,12,wwswswswwswwsw
opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,dactyl,6,58,11,sswswswswswsswsw
westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee,dactyl,6,53,9,wswswswswswswsw
eastward with devious course among the wind river mountains,dactyl,6,59,9,wswswswswswswsw
through the sweet water valley precipitate leaps the nebraska,dactyl,6,61,9,wswswsswswswswsw
and to the south from fontaine qui bout and the spanish sierras,dactyl,6,63,12,wwswswswswwsswsw
fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert,dactyl,6,64,13,swswswswswswwsw
numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean,dactyl,6,61,9,swswswswswswwsw
like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswwswswsswsw
spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,dactyl,6,67,9,sswswswwswswsws
billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,dactyl,6,57,10,swswswswsswsswsw
bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas,dactyl,6,59,9,wswswsswswswswsw
over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck,dactyl,6,64,12,swswswswswswswwsw
over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswsswsw
fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswsswsw
over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmael's children,dactyl,6,59,9,swswswswswswsw
staining the desert with blood and above their terrible war trails,dactyl,6,66,11,sswswswswswswsws
circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture,dactyl,6,55,9,wswswswswswsswsw
like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,dactyl,6,61,10,wswswswswswswsws
by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens,dactyl,6,53,8,swswswswswsswsw
here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders,dactyl,6,67,12,wwswswwswwsswsw
here and there rise groves from the margins of swift running rivers,dactyl,6,67,12,wswswswswswswsw
and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswsswswswsw
climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook side,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswswswswsws
and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven,dactyl,6,56,11,wsswswswswswsw
like the protecting hand of god inverted above them,dactyl,6,51,9,wswswswswswsws
into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswwswsw
gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him,dactyl,6,60,10,sswswswswswsswsw
day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswwswswsswsw
followed his flying steps and thought each day to o'ertake him,dactyl,6,62,11,sswswswswswsws
sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp fire,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswswswswswsw
rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswwsswswsw
when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes,dactyl,6,64,12,wwswswswswswsws
and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswwsswsw
hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,dactyl,6,51,10,swswswswswsswsw
showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them,dactyl,6,70,12,wswswswswswsswsw
once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswwswsswsswsw
into their little camp an indian woman whose features,dactyl,6,53,9,wswswswswsswsw
wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow,dactyl,6,62,12,swsswsswswswswsw
she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,dactyl,6,52,10,wswswsswswswwsw
from the far off hunting grounds of the cruel camanches,dactyl,6,55,10,wwswswswwswssw
where her canadian husband a coureur des bois had been murdered,dactyl,6,63,11,wswsswswswswswwsw
touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,dactyl,6,74,12,wswswwswswswswsw
gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswswswswswsw
on the buffalo meat and the venison cooked on the embers,dactyl,6,56,11,wwswswswswswswsw
but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions,dactyl,6,61,12,wwswswwsswwswsw
worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,dactyl,6,70,15,wswswswswswswwsw
stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering fire light,dactyl,6,75,12,swswswswswsswsws
flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,dactyl,6,76,13,wswswswswswswsw
then at the door of evangeline's tent she sat and repeated,dactyl,6,58,11,wwswswswswswswsw
slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent,dactyl,6,61,12,swswswswswwswsws
all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswwswswswsw
much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another,dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswswswswsw
hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed,dactyl,6,62,11,sswswswswswswsw
moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,dactyl,6,62,12,wswswwswsswsswsw
yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,dactyl,6,64,13,wswsswswswswsws
she in turn related her love and all its disasters,dactyl,6,50,10,wwswsswswwswsw
mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswwsw
still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror,dactyl,6,54,11,wswswswwswsswsw
passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis,dactyl,6,69,13,swswswswswswswsw
mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden,dactyl,6,56,11,swswswswswsswsw
but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswwsw
fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,dactyl,6,56,9,swswswswswswswsw
till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswswswsw
then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation,dactyl,6,66,12,wswswswswswswsw
told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom,dactyl,6,64,14,wswswswswswswswsw
that through the pines o'er her father's lodge in the hush of the twilight,dactyl,6,74,14,wswswwswswswswsw
breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden,dactyl,6,63,11,wswswswswswwsw
till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,dactyl,6,63,11,wwsswswswswwsw
and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswwswswwsw
silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,dactyl,6,59,8,swswswswswswsws
to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswwswswswswsws
seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress,dactyl,6,66,10,wswswswswswswsw
slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswswswsws
lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,dactyl,6,55,9,sswswswwswsswsw
touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland,dactyl,6,65,10,swswswswsswsswsw
with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswwsw
swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers,dactyl,6,55,8,wswswswswsswsw
filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,dactyl,6,68,12,swswswswswswswsw
subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,dactyl,6,52,9,wswswswswsswsw
as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswwsw
it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits,dactyl,6,58,12,wswswswswswswsw
seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment,dactyl,6,61,14,wswswswswswswsw
that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswswswsws
with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished,dactyl,6,69,13,wwswswwswwswsww
early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswswwsw
said as they journeyed along 'on the western slope of these mountains,dactyl,6,69,12,wswswswswswswwsw
dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswswsw
much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus,dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswswswsswsw
loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him',dactyl,6,69,14,wswswswswswsws
then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered,dactyl,6,57,9,wswsswswswswswsws
let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us',dactyl,6,57,12,wswswsswswsswsw
thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswswswwsw
just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices,dactyl,6,55,12,wswswswswswsws
and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river,dactyl,6,54,13,wswswswswswswsw
saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswsswsw
under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village,dactyl,6,59,12,wswswswswswswwsw
knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswsw
high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswwswswsswsw
looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it,dactyl,6,66,11,wswswswswswswswsw
this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswsswswswswsw
of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers,dactyl,6,51,10,wwsswswswswwsw
mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswswswswwsw
silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching,dactyl,6,61,8,sswswsswsswsswsw
knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsw
but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswswsws
forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower,dactyl,6,72,15,wswswswswswswwsw
slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them,dactyl,6,63,11,sswsswswswwswsws
welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression,dactyl,6,65,10,swswswswswswswsw
hearing the homelike sounds of his mother tongue in the forest,dactyl,6,62,11,sswswswwswswwsw
and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswswsw
there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maize ear,dactyl,6,68,14,swswswswswswswsw
feasted and slaked their thirst from the water gourd of the teacher,dactyl,6,67,12,swswswswswswwsw
soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered,dactyl,6,64,11,wswswswswswswsws
nor six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated,dactyl,6,52,10,swswsswswsswsw
on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes,dactyl,6,51,11,wwswwswswsswsw
told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey',dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswsswsw
soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,dactyl,6,72,15,wswswswswswswswsw
but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow flakes,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswwswsws
fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswwswswsw
far to the north he has gone' continued the priest 'but in autumn,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswwswswswswsw
when the chase is done will return again to the mission',dactyl,6,56,11,wwswwswswswwsw
then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive,dactyl,6,58,10,swswswswswswsws
let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted',dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswswswsw
so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswwsw
mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions,dactyl,6,64,10,wswswswswswswswsw
homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission,dactyl,6,60,9,swswswswswswswsw
slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other,dactyl,6,50,8,swswswswswswsw
days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing,dactyl,6,69,13,wswswswswswwsw
green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswsswsw
lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming,dactyl,6,63,9,swswswswswsswsw
cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels,dactyl,6,65,9,swswswswsswsswsw
then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswsw
blushed at each blood red ear for that betokened a lover,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswsswsw
but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield,dactyl,6,65,13,wswswswswswswsw
even the blood red ear to evangeline brought not her lover,dactyl,6,58,11,swswswswswswswsw
patience' the priest would say 'have faith and thy prayer will be answered,dactyl,6,74,13,sswswswswswswsw
look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswsw
see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet,dactyl,6,64,14,wswswswswswswsw
this is the compass flower that the finger of god has planted,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswsws
here in the houseless wild to direct the traveller's journey,dactyl,6,60,10,wswsswswswsswsw
over the sea like pathless limitless waste of the desert,dactyl,6,56,10,sswswswswswswsw
such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswswswsswsw
gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance,dactyl,6,62,10,wswswsswsswsswsw
but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswwsswsw
only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter,dactyl,6,54,10,wswswswswwswsw
crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe',dactyl,6,70,13,swswswswswswswswsw
so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswswswsw
blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,dactyl,6,68,12,sswswswswswwsswsw
sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not,dactyl,6,56,11,swswswswswswsws
but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswwswswswsws
sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom,dactyl,6,51,11,wswswswswsswsw
far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswswswwsswsw
gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river,dactyl,6,55,11,sswwswwswwswsww
and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswsws
saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission,dactyl,6,54,9,sswswswswswswsw
when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,dactyl,6,49,9,wswswswswsswsw
she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswwsswsw
found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswswsw
thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswswsw
divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden,dactyl,6,52,9,sswswswswswsw
now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswwswsswsw
now in the noisy camps and the battle fields of the army,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswswwswswwsw
now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities,dactyl,6,52,9,wswswswswswswsw
like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered,dactyl,6,52,9,wwswswswswswsw
fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey,dactyl,6,58,12,wswwswwswswssw
faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended,dactyl,6,53,10,swswswswswswsws
each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,dactyl,6,57,9,swswswswswswsw
leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswswwsw
then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dactyl,6,70,12,wswswswswswwsw
dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswswsw
as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswswswwsw
in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware waters,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsws
guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,dactyl,6,54,10,swswswswswswsw
stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswsswsw
there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,dactyl,6,63,14,wswswswswswswsws
and the streets still re echo the names of the trees of the forest,dactyl,6,66,14,wswswswswswswwsw
as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested,dactyl,6,67,12,wwswswswswswswsw
there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile,dactyl,6,58,10,wswsswswswswswsw
finding among the children of penn a home and a country,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswswsw
there old ren leblanc had died and when he departed,dactyl,6,51,10,wswswswswswsw
saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants,dactyl,6,55,11,swswswswswswsws
something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,dactyl,6,64,12,swswswswswswwsw
something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger,dactyl,6,67,13,swswswswswswswsw
and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers,dactyl,6,61,13,wwswswswwswwsw
for it recalled the past the old acadian country,dactyl,6,48,9,wswswswswsswsw
where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters,dactyl,6,58,11,wwswswswwsswsw
so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,dactyl,6,54,8,wswswswswswsws
ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,dactyl,6,52,8,wswswswswswswsw
thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps,dactyl,6,73,13,swswswswswswwsw
as from the mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning,dactyl,6,57,11,wswswswswswwsw
roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us,dactyl,6,51,10,swswswswswswsws
sun illumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,dactyl,6,56,9,wswswswsswsswsw
so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her,dactyl,6,67,15,wswswwswswswswsw
dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswswsw
which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance,dactyl,6,66,13,wwswswswswswwsw
gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image,dactyl,6,56,10,swswswsswswswwsw
clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him,dactyl,6,62,13,wswswswswswswsw
only more beautiful made by his death like silence and absence,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswsswsw
into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswswswswsws
over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured,dactyl,6,63,12,swswswswswswswsw
he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent,dactyl,6,60,14,wswswwswswswswsw
patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others,dactyl,6,54,9,sswswswswswsswsw
this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her,dactyl,6,61,13,wswsswswsswswsws
so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices,dactyl,6,56,11,wswswswswwsswsw
suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma,dactyl,6,60,11,sswswswswswswsw
other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow,dactyl,6,54,12,swswswswswswsw
meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour,dactyl,6,57,10,wswsswswswswwsw
thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswwsswswsws
lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswwswswwsw
where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,dactyl,6,62,9,swswswswswwsw
where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected,dactyl,6,56,8,swswsswswswsws
night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswswsw
loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,dactyl,6,60,12,wswsswswwswwsw
high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper,dactyl,6,56,12,wswswswswswswsw
day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,dactyl,6,65,14,wswswswswswswwsw
plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,dactyl,6,64,11,sswswswswswswsw
met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings,dactyl,6,60,11,wswswswswswwsw
then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,dactyl,6,55,12,wwswswwsswswwsw
presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,dactyl,6,63,11,sswswswswswswsw
darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn,dactyl,6,73,14,swswswswswswswwsw
and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswwswswswswsw
flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,dactyl,6,67,13,sswswswswswswwsw
so death flooded life and o'erflowing its natural margin,dactyl,6,56,9,swswswswswsswsw
spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence,dactyl,6,56,10,wswswswswswsws
wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor,dactyl,6,62,12,wswsswswswswswsw
but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger,dactyl,6,55,10,wwsswswswswwsw
only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants,dactyl,6,57,10,wswswswswswswsw
crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless,dactyl,6,55,11,swswswwswswwsw
then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswswswsswsw
now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket,dactyl,6,63,12,swsswswswswsswsw
meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seemed to echo,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswswswsw
softly the words of the lord 'the poor ye always have with you',dactyl,6,63,13,swswswswswswsws
thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying,dactyl,6,62,13,sswswswswswswswsw
looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there,dactyl,6,58,11,wswswswswswsws
gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,dactyl,6,61,9,wswswswswswswsw
such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswswsw
or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance,dactyl,6,56,13,wswswswwsswswsw
unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,dactyl,6,57,11,swswswswswsswsw
into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter,dactyl,6,58,9,wswswswsswsswsw
thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsw
wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswswsw
sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswwsswswswsw
and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,dactyl,6,58,12,wwswwswsswsswsw
that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty,dactyl,6,68,12,wwswswswswwsswsw
then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind,dactyl,6,71,14,wswswswswswswswsw
distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church,dactyl,6,76,15,swswswswswswswsws
while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted,dactyl,6,60,9,wswswswsswsswsw
sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco,dactyl,6,71,14,wswswswwswswswsw
soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit,dactyl,6,64,13,wswswswswswswswsw
something within her said 'at length thy trials are ended',dactyl,6,58,10,wswswswswsswsw
and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness,dactyl,6,64,12,wswswswswswswsw
noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants,dactyl,6,56,7,swswswswswswsws
moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence,dactyl,6,62,11,swswswswswswswwsw
closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces,dactyl,6,65,11,sswswswswswswsws
where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside,dactyl,6,67,13,wswswswswswswsw
many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered,dactyl,6,50,8,sswswswswswswsw
turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence,dactyl,6,70,14,wswswswswswswwsw
fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison,dactyl,6,67,16,wswswswswswswswsw
and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler,dactyl,6,55,11,wswswswswswsws
laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever,dactyl,6,55,11,swswswswswswswsw
many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time,dactyl,6,53,9,sswswswswswsws
vacant their places were or filled already by strangers,dactyl,6,55,9,sswsswwswsswsw
suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,dactyl,6,54,11,swswswswswswswsws
still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswsswswswwsw
ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers,dactyl,6,74,12,swswswsswswswswsw
and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning,dactyl,6,63,13,wswswswswswwsw
then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,dactyl,6,63,12,wswswswswswsswsw
that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows,dactyl,6,57,11,wwsswswswswwsw
on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man,dactyl,6,61,13,wwsswswwswswwsw
long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswswsswsw
but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment,dactyl,6,56,13,wswswwswswswwsw
seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood,dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswwswsw
so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying,dactyl,6,58,13,wwswwswsswwswsw
hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,dactyl,6,59,13,wswswswswswwsw
as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,dactyl,6,65,12,wswswswswswswsws
that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over,dactyl,6,56,12,wwswswswswswsw
motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,dactyl,6,58,9,sswswswswswsswsw
seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,dactyl,6,65,11,wswswswswswswsw
darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking,dactyl,6,57,9,swswswswswswsws
then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations,dactyl,6,63,9,wswswswswswswsw
heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded,dactyl,6,61,12,wswswswwswswsw
whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saint like,dactyl,6,57,10,sswswswswswsws
gabriel o my beloved' and died away into silence,dactyl,6,48,9,swswswswswswsws
then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood,dactyl,6,61,13,wswswswswswswsw
green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them,dactyl,6,51,8,swsswsswswsswsw
village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow,dactyl,6,65,10,sswswswswswswsws
as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision,dactyl,6,57,12,wswswwswswswswsw
tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,dactyl,6,60,12,wswswswwswswswsw
vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside,dactyl,6,60,10,sswswswswswswswsw
vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered,dactyl,6,62,11,wswswswswswswsws
died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken,dactyl,6,76,14,wswswwsswswswswsw
vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him,dactyl,6,59,10,swswswswswswswsw
kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom,dactyl,6,52,11,swswswswswwsw
sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness,dactyl,6,66,13,wswswswswswswswsw
as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement,dactyl,6,59,15,wswswswwswswswsw
all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,dactyl,6,54,12,wwswswswwswwsw
all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,dactyl,6,56,9,wwsswswswswwssw
all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience,dactyl,6,55,10,wwswswswswsww
and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,dactyl,6,59,12,wwswswwswswwsw
meekly she bowed her own and murmured 'father i thank thee',dactyl,6,59,11,wswswswswswsws
still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswswswwsw
side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping,dactyl,6,61,11,wswswswswsswsw
under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard,dactyl,6,56,9,wswswswwswswsw
in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed,dactyl,6,55,11,wwswwsswswswsww
daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,dactyl,6,57,11,sswswswsswsswsw
thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever,dactyl,6,66,11,sswswswswswswsw
thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy,dactyl,6,58,10,sswswswswswsws
thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors,dactyl,6,69,11,sswsswswwswwsw
thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey,dactyl,6,65,10,sswswswswswswsw
still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches,dactyl,6,68,12,wswswswswswswswsw
dwells another race with other customs and language,dactyl,6,51,8,swswswswsswsw
only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,dactyl,6,55,10,wswswswswswsswsw
linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,dactyl,6,54,9,wswswsswsswsswsw
wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom,dactyl,6,54,11,swswwswswswwsw
in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy,dactyl,6,60,12,wwsswswswswswsw
maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,dactyl,6,66,11,sswswswswwsswsw
and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story,dactyl,6,49,8,wswswsswswswsws
